### Part I, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Experiencing Level 0

John Doe

I've been wandering Level 0 for hours now, trying to find a way out. The fluorescent lights hum and buzz constantly, making it hard to focus on anything else. I can't seem to find any entrances or exits, and I'm starting to lose hope.

I keep walking, but everything feels so blurry. Suddenly, I hear a noise behind me. I turn around to see a group of people with strange faces approaching me. They start speaking in a language I don't understand, and I can only respond in Spanish. They seem friendly enough, but I'm not sure what to do next.

I try to keep going, but my legs feel heavy as if I'm being weighed down by something. I look around and see that the walls are made of a strange material that seems to be melting into the ceiling. The fluorescent lights are flickering in an unnatural way, and the air tastes different.

I hear a door creaking open behind me, and I turn around to see a man with a gun holding it open for me. He tells me to follow him, and we start walking down a hall filled with more doors. I can't tell which ones are safe to enter and which ones lead to the exit.

As we walk, I realize that the man is speaking in English, and I respond in Spanish. I don't know what he says, but I hope it means something helpful. We keep walking, and suddenly, I see a light at the end of the hall. It leads to a room with a familiar sight: a bed, a table, and a window.

I enter the room and find my backpack and phone inside. I start to cry as I realize that I've been wandering for hours, lost and alone. But then, I see my friends approaching me, and I smile. They seem to understand what I'm saying, and they want to help me find my way out of Level 0.

We continue walking, and suddenly, we come across a bridge that leads to Level 13. I can't believe it! I take a deep breath and start running towards the other side.

As I cross over the bridge, I see a familiar sight: the Backrooms logo in the sky. I run as fast as I can, feeling the wind rushing past me, and I finally reach Level 13. I'm safe!

### Part I, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear Reader,

I hope this message finds you well. As a reminder, this is a true account of my experiences in Level 13. I have been wandering around the endless space for several days now and I am still struggling to find any semblance of order in my surroundings. The floors are always shifting, the textures are always changing, and the lighting is never consistent.

The first few days were surreal. The sensation of floating in mid-air was initially unsettling but eventually became a part of my routine. I would explore each level, taking note of any unique features that caught my attention. But as time passed, things started to feel more and more chaotic. The once peaceful environments became filled with chaos, destruction, and random violence.

One day, I found myself in a room that seemed to be a combination of several different levels. The walls were made of glass, allowing me to see the outside world beyond. But as I looked out, I saw a group of people rushing towards me. They were wearing strange clothing and had weapons in hand. Without thinking, I ran towards them, hoping to escape their wrath.

To my surprise, they did not attack me. Instead, they led me to a nearby elevator that was out of service. They told me that if I could find the correct keycard to repair it, I would be free to leave Level 13. The elevator was old and rickety, but with some quick thinking and a bit of luck, I managed to fix it.

As I stepped outside, I saw a vast landscape stretching out in front of me. I looked around, taking in the beauty of this new environment. But as I began to walk, I realized that I had lost my way. I tried retracing my steps, but everything looked the same. I felt like I was lost forever.

As I walked down a path, I saw a group of people gathered around a large object in the distance. Curiosity got the better of me and I approached them. To my surprise, they were not humans but some kind of alien race. They seemed friendly enough and offered me a ride back to Level 13 in their spaceship.

I accepted their offer and soon found myself back in my own world. But as I looked out at the skyline, I realized that I had changed in some way. My perspective on life was different, and I felt like I could handle anything that came my way. I left Level 13 with a newfound sense of purpose and a desire to explore more of the universe.

Thank you for reading this message.

### Part I, Chapter 3: Level 1

Subject: Message from John Doe

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. As many of you may know, I was lost in Level 1 for several days after being separated from my group. However, I have finally made it out and would like to share some insights from my experience.

Firstly, I must say that the level is an absolute maze. The architecture changes constantly, making navigation a challenging task. It is not uncommon for us to spend hours exploring one area only to find that the layout has completely changed.

Secondly, I have encountered entities that are extremely aggressive and violent. They have attacked me on multiple occasions, and it is best to avoid any confrontation at all costs.

Lastly, I have discovered a hidden room in Level 13 that leads directly to Level 2. The door is located behind a bookshelf, and it is a significant distance from the entrance. It is not recommended to explore this level further until you have gained more experience.

I hope that my message helps some of you. I will be waiting for any updates on the progress of your own adventures in Level 1.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part I, Chapter 4: Level 2

"I thought I was going to die in Level 2. The heat and steam were unbearable, and there were too many Facelings and Hounds lurking around. Every time I tried to move ahead, I would get cooked alive. I kept running and running until I found an office-style elevator that would take me to Level 4. It was only a temporary escape, but it was a relief to be out of there."

The following message was received from John Doe while they were wandering Level 4. No further communications have been received since.

### Part II, Chapter 1: Level 0


Jane Doe
I'm not sure how to navigate Level 0. The fluorescent lighting hums at a constant frequency, and there are no consistent patterns in the layout of the rooms. It's difficult to find my way back to familiar spaces without getting lost. I've seen other wanderers disappear due to dehydration, starvation, and exhaustion, and the fluid saturating the carpet is considered unsafe for consumption. 

I keep encountering oddities such as doorways constructed out of glass that lead to Level 13, but they are rare occurrences. I've tried to find a way out of Level 0 multiple times but have only found dead-ends. 

I'm currently stuck in Level 12. There is no apparent way out of this level, and I don't know how to progress further into the Backrooms. The lack of resources and navigation difficulties make it difficult to find a way out.

### Part III, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experience of Level 13 and its sublevels. As you may know, Level 13 is a mysterious and dangerous place where one can encounter strange phenomena, including the anomalous void that seems to swallow anyone who dares to venture too far. However, I have been able to reach Level 996, a sublevel of Level 13 with extremely rare circumstances that may not be possible for most people.

I encountered a number of challenges along the way, including the sudden appearance of a strange creature that seemed to lead me through the void, and the possibility of falling into the void forever. However, I persevered and found my way to the sublevels of Level 996. There, I discovered a strange world with many unanswered questions, as well as new challenges to face.

I hope this message reaches you all and that you are safe wherever you may be. Thank you for your support and encouragement during this experience.

John Doe

### Part III, Chapter 3: Level 996


Thank you for your report. It seems that I was lost in the City and wandering around for a long time before I finally found a location where I could exit. The experience of Level 996 was quite surreal, with strange architecture, sky, and objects that were dangerous to navigate. However, I am now safe and back in my home, and I will try to avoid returning to the City if possible. Please pass along any further information you may have on Level 0 or other areas. Thank you for your help.

### Part III, Chapter 4: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

I'm sorry for the delay, but I felt it was important to document my experiences in Level 0. Here are some of my observations:

- Linear space is constantly changing, making navigation difficult. It's like trying to follow a maze where you can never quite find your way back to the starting point.

- The fluorescent lighting hums at a constant frequency, creating a buzzing in the air that can be heard from miles away. It's like the sound of a vacuum cleaner, but much louder and more constant.

- Despite the lack of available resources, it is still possible to find food and water. I have seen people wandering around with empty pockets, yet they were able to scavenge for sustenance.

- The walls are made of a crumbly, damp material that can easily give way under pressure. This creates an unstable environment that could collapse at any moment, making navigation even more difficult.

- There are numerous entrances and exits in Level 0, but they all lead to the same space. It's like a maze where you can never quite find your way out.

- Entities have not been reported, but it's unclear whether they exist within Level 0. The lack of interaction with other wanderers makes it difficult to verify any claims.

Overall, Level 0 is a strange and dangerous place that requires constant vigilance and resourcefulness to navigate. Despite the challenges, I found it fascinating to explore this unique space and the mysteries it holds.

### Part III, Chapter 5: Level 13

To my family, friends, and anyone who may be able to help me:

I am writing this letter to you all because I need your support during this difficult time. I have been wandering Level 13 for several days now, and it has been a very challenging experience for me. However, I have found some evidence that might lead me to Level 909, which is believed to be the location of my missing loved ones.

I have encountered various obstacles on my journey, including strange textures on the floor that made me feel uneasy. I have also seen a few areas where the space seems to shake unpredictably, but I have managed to avoid them so far. Unfortunately, I have not been able to find any clues or evidence that would help me locate Level 909.

Although the journey has been long and tiring, I am determined to find my missing loved ones and bring them back home safely. I am hoping that you can provide me with any information that might lead me closer to my goal. If you have any updates on their whereabouts, please let me know as soon as possible.

Thank you for your love and support during this difficult time. I will keep you updated on my progress.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part III, Chapter 6: Level 14

To my knowledge, I have not left Level 14. I have been wandering this complex for several days now, and I am trying to find a way out. However, I cannot seem to locate any exits or entry points that lead me to Level -6. It seems like I am trapped here forever.

To: M.E.G. Operative  (@meg.bri)
Subject: Strange anomalies are occurring in Level -6.

---

Hello ,I've decided to contact you about an undergoing change in Level -6, as it looks completely different from what I remember. Green smog can be found every where, the trees appear to be rotting, the grass turned into an orange-like color, and the plants here appear to withering. I don't know if this is a new level I've discovered, but I am sure that this has to be Level -6 because I entered a glass door in Level 6. Att. u/9io.

### Part III, Chapter 8: Level 64

Subject: Report on Level 64

I am writing this report to provide an accurate account of my experience exploring Level 64. As a citizen, it is important to keep an eye on the conditions in which we live and work. I found the level to be desolate, with only vines and mushrooms as flora. The ground was covered in vines that were constantly dripping and emitting a toxic liquid. The vines seemed to survive on this fluid and caused constant pain. 

I had heard stories about the liquid above Level 64, and I was determined to explore it. As I ventured further up, I discovered that the liquid was not just harmful but contagious. Its effects were felt by anyone who came into contact with it. I saw entities hopping through the levels, and I knew that this level was at risk of being lost.

I had researched the potential methods of containing or destroying the threat, and my experiments showed promising results. However, I did not want to panic the public. Therefore, I kept my findings confidential. 

In conclusion, I recommend that Level 64 be left undisturbed, and any attempts to explore it should be done with caution. The people of Main 9 should be informed of this contagion, but they should avoid any unnecessary contact with the level until more is known about its effects.

Location: Level 65

I thought I was lost forever, but I finally found my way back to the playground. It was like a dream, but it was real. The memories were all there, and I could still feel the sand between my toes as we swung from one slide to another. It was like nothing had changed, except for me.

But then I realized something was different. I could see things moving in the distance, and they seemed to be closing in on me. I tried to run, but I couldn't move fast enough. Suddenly, I was surrounded by a dark entity that didn't want me to leave. It whispered in my ear, telling me to stay. But I knew I had to try.

I found a hidden room in the playground and used a device to transport myself to another world. It was like waking up from a dream, but I realized I had to keep going. I found a group of people who helped me understand what was happening, and we worked together to find a way back home.

It was months before I returned to Level 65, and I was forever changed by the experience. But I knew that if I could make it back there, then anything was possible.

Subject: Experiences in Level 11

I'm sorry, I'm not sure what you're asking for. Could you please provide more context or information about the message you're referring to?

### Part III, Chapter 12: Level 10

Thank you for your help in investigating Level 10. I'm sorry to report that I have not found any other leads for my return home. While exploring the level, I discovered a small group of people who seem to be living in harmony with the environment. They have been able to sustain themselves by using the resources available in the area, such as the wheat and barley fields. They also have a small farm that includes chickens and pigs, which they use for food. The atmosphere is peaceful and tranquil, with no signs of danger or threat. I plan to continue exploring this level and report back any further updates.

### Part III, Chapter 13: Level 11

I've been wandering Level 11 for a few days now, and I have to say, it's getting pretty boring. There's no life to be found here, not even any plants or animals. The buildings are all the same, and there doesn't seem to be anything interesting to explore. I keep hoping that I'll finally find something, but so far, nothing.

I keep trying to find a way out of here, but every time I try to move forward, I get lost and have to retrace my steps. It's frustrating, but I guess I'll just have to keep wandering until I find something new. Maybe I'll make it to Level 2 or 3 before I give up.

### Part III, Chapter 14: Level 85

Subject: Update from Level 8

Dear SherlsF,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give you an update on my experience in Level 8. As you know, I have been wandering around the level for a while now, and I have yet to find any exit. However, I am not giving up easily. In fact, I have discovered a few things that might interest you.

Firstly, Level 8 is filled with many strange creatures that are not easy to spot. One day, I stumbled upon a group of them while exploring the woods. They were beautiful, but also dangerous. I quickly ran away and continued my journey. However, I have learned from experience that they can be very unpredictable.

Secondly, I have discovered a hidden room deep within Level 8 that leads to other levels. I have been trying to find my way back to my previous location ever since I found the room. However, I have not succeeded yet. I hope you can understand how difficult it is to navigate through the level without proper equipment or guidance.

Finally, I wanted to share a little bit about my surroundings. Level 8 is surrounded by a dense forest that seems to go on forever. The trees are so tall that they block out most of the sunlight, making the area seem eerie and foreboding. I have also encountered some strange structures in the woods that are unlike anything I have ever seen before.

I hope this update finds you well. Please keep me in mind if you need any help or information about Level 8. Take care and stay safe.

Best regards,

John Doe

Hi,

I hope I am still alive and safe. I have been wandering around Level 9 for a while now, and it seems like I am not getting any closer to my destination. The terrain is tough, and the buildings are always in the way. I can't seem to find any clear path or landmarks that would lead me to Level 13. Every time I try to exit, I end up back in Level 8 or 9.

I have been keeping a low profile, avoiding any unnecessary encounters with the entities present here. However, I have noticed that some of the buildings are not as broken as others. They assist the wanderers to evade dangerous properties, such as segments of broken pavements and entities lurking around the corners of the houses.

I have been staying in a shelter for a while now, but I am looking for a place to rest and stay for a while. I would appreciate any information or guidance that can help me find my way to Level 13. Thank you.

### Part III, Chapter 17: Level 13

"I've been wandering Level 13 for hours now. The floors are unstable and I can't find my way out. Every time I try to climb up or down, I fall through the floor. It feels like I'm in a dream world where reality just slips away.

But then I spot something familiar. It's a familiar building, just not the one I know. The walls are different and the windows are smashed. I recognize it from somewhere - I think it might be Level 3.

I run towards the building, but as I get closer, the ground starts to shake and shake. Suddenly, I'm in a completely different world. The sky is purple and the trees are green, and I can hear a strange melody in the distance.

As I follow the sound, I realize that I'm on a beach. But there's something strange about this beach - it's filled with sand instead of water, and the waves are made of light. The people here seem to be happy and carefree, but they seem to know something I don't.

I follow the melody and find myself in a clearing. In front of me is a small cottage, and inside is a strange creature. It's like a cross between a human and an animal - it has fur on its arms and legs, but its face is human.

The creature looks at me with big eyes and speaks to me in a language I don't understand. It tells me that I'm in The Void, a place where everything and nothing exists at the same time. And it shows me something incredible - a sub-level of Level 13 filled with strange creatures and unimaginable wonders.

I leave the creature and continue exploring, but now I can't find my way back to Level 13. I don't know how long I've been here or what will happen next, but I know that this place is full of magic and mystery. And I hope to find a way out."

### Part III, Chapter 20: Level 1

To my fellow travelers,

I have been wandering Level 1 for a few days now and have had some strange experiences. First, there was the time I encountered a Faceling who told me that Level 1 was not just a level, but a separate dimension. I also saw a Hound patrolling the hallway, but he didn't seem hostile.

One day, I came across a strange structure that seemed to be made of paper. I could barely make out the words it was saying. It seemed to be trying to communicate with me, but I couldn't understand what it was saying. Then, without warning, the structure just disappeared.

I keep finding strange items as I explore Level 1. Today, I found a backpack with a note attached that said "Please help yourself." I have no idea what it means, but I assume it's some kind of code.

I have heard rumors about an elevator in Level 1. It's said that if you press the button and it lights up, you will be transported to Level 2. I hope to find a way to check this out soon.

Despite the strange experiences, I'm enjoying my time wandering Level 1. I just hope I don't run into any hostile entities or meet any other travelers on my journey.

I have been wandering Level 3 for the past few hours. The level is eerily quiet, with noises that could be described as electrical discharges. I've encountered multiple strange machines that are unidentifiable to me. One particular machine had a white sign above it with numbers, and it seemed to lead me to a room with a window. The window looked out to an empty gray space, with no signs of life around it. I have not seen any entities in the level, but I'm still feeling uneasy. I hope to find some form of exit soon.

### Part IV, Chapter 1: Level 0

From Level -1, John Doe writes:

I was wandering around Level -1 and suddenly found myself in a different part of the level. The space felt different, as if I had wandered too far off course. As I tried to find my way back to the starting point, I realized that the fluorescent lighting was buzzing at a higher frequency. The walls were covered in patches of different textures, and I could hear the sound of water running somewhere in the distance.

Despite this, I managed to find my way back to the starting point by following my sense of direction. However, as I stepped outside into Level 0, I realized that my body had become dehydrated and hungry. The buzzing fluorescent lighting was so loud that it made it difficult to hear my own thoughts, but I managed to find a few sources of water nearby and started drinking.

As I wandered around Level 0, I noticed that some of the rooms were identical in layout, while others seemed completely different. It was hard to navigate through the maze of rooms without getting lost, as the walls seemed to change color and texture in every direction.

After a few hours of wandering, I managed to find a way out of Level 0 by breaking through a wall and following it into The Void. From there, I continued my journey and eventually found myself back at Level -1, where I left off. Despite the challenges of Level 0, I feel like I have gained valuable experience in navigating through the Backrooms.

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I have been wandering Level -9 for a while now, and I wanted to take some time to reflect on my experiences so far. It has been quite an adventure, exploring this strange and wondrous place.

As I continued on my journey, I began to notice something strange happening to me. I found myself constantly teleporting back to Level -10. The landscape was different each time, but the feeling of being lost in a vast, empty space was always the same. It was as if I had been transported into an alternate reality where time and space were fluid.

I encountered many strange creatures along the way, some friendly while others not so much. I even found myself trapped inside a decrepit old apartment for what felt like hours, only to discover that it was just a simulation created by Level -40.

As I continue on my journey, I can't help but feel as though there is something greater at work here. It's as if I am being guided towards some great unknown, and I can't help but wonder what it could be.

I hope you are all doing well. If you hear of me or any other wandering travelers in this strange place, please let me know. And if you happen to find yourself on Level -10, feel free to give me a wave.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part IV, Chapter 6: Level 9

Subject: My Journey

Hello there,

I am sending this message from Level 8.4. It has been a long time since I last wrote to you. As I look back on my journey here, it seems like a lifetime. However, I want to share with you some of the experiences that I had along the way.

My journey started in Level 9, where I found myself wandering aimlessly through the streets, lost and alone. It was then that I came across a party, and it seemed like an oasis in the midst of my despair. The music, the drinks, and the people there were exactly what I needed to keep going.

As I continued on my journey, I encountered some strange and unsettling sights. There were buildings that seemed to collapse on me as I walked past them, and other structures that were so broken they offered no useful objects. However, the party was always a welcome sight.

Despite the challenges, I have been able to document my journey through these experiences. The memories of the people I met along the way, the places I visited, and the things I saw will stay with me forever. I have learned so much from this experience, and I am grateful for the opportunity to have taken this journey.

Thank you all for your support and guidance throughout this journey. It means a lot to me, and I hope that I can continue to contribute something positive to the world in the future. 

Sincerely,
John Doe

Letter from John Doe while wandering Level 8.4

Dear Wandering Friends,

I hope this letter finds you well. I have been wandering Level 8.4 for a few days now and it has been quite an experience. The level is vast and full of surprises.

At first, I found the environment to be rather eerie with hardly any sounds around. However, as I continued exploring, I discovered that the level was not as quiet as I thought. There were occasional loud noises that scared me. I have never experienced such a thing before.

I was amazed by the number of homes present in this level. It is definitely safe to say that Level 8.4 has some of the most comfortable and well-maintained homes I have ever seen. The residents are friendly and always open to trade with us wanderers. However, they do not tolerate any disrespect towards their homes.

The homes in Level 8.4 only consist of a dinner table, a lamp, and a bed. They have no other furniture or appliances. It is quite sad that we wanderers do not have access to such basic amenities as the locals.

I have been exploring different areas within the level and I must say that it is quite vast. There are many different habitats, from flatlands to mountains, which have their own unique characteristics. The caves in Level 8.4 are also very beautiful and full of glittering gems.

In conclusion, Level 8.4 has been a unique experience for me. I am grateful to have had the opportunity to explore such an extensive level. However, I must continue wandering until I find a way out.

Sincerely,

John Doe

MESSAGE FROM JANUARY 1, 2021

To my family, friends, and anyone who may have heard of me:

I am alive and well. I have been wandering through Level 37.1 for quite some time now, and although it has been a long and challenging journey, I have found a sense of peace in the chaos. The world outside Level 37.1 is vast and full of wonders, but I have come to realize that I am content with my current surroundings.

I would like to share some of the experiences I have had while wandering through Level 37.1. It has been a long time since I last wrote my last message. My journey has taken me through many dark and dangerous areas, but I have found a way to keep going. The unnatural properties of Level 37.1 have made it difficult for me to comprehend, but I have managed to find a way to make sense of it all.

I would like to thank everyone who has been supportive throughout my journey. Without you, I may not have found the strength to keep going. I hope that I can continue to inspire others to discover the beauty in the unknown.

In conclusion, I am grateful for the experiences I have had and the memories I have made while wandering through Level 37.1. However, I am ready to move on to new adventures and experiences. Thank you all for your support and love.

John Doe.

### Part IV, Chapter 9: Level 37.4

"The Liminal Waterpark"

I wandered through this place for days, lost in the maze of winding waterslides. It's like a waterpark from my childhood, but with an additional layer of chaos. The Frontrooms are so far away now - it feels like just another fantasy amidst the chaos of this level.

But I didn't let that stop me. I kept going and eventually found myself at the top of one of those winding waterslides. As I slid down, I felt my heart pounding in my chest. But then, suddenly, I was out of the water and on Level 37.4. 

I wandered around for a while, taking in the sights and sounds of this strange place. It's hard to describe - it feels like a mix between a chaotic dream and a waterpark gone wrong. There are Facelings wandering around, but they don't seem to be causing any trouble. 

The only other encounters I had were with Smilers who were very friendly. They didn't seem to want anything from me - they just wanted to chat. But Lurkers lurked in darker areas, always keeping an eye out for anyone who might pose a threat.

I don't know how long I stayed here. I don't even remember the day of my arrival. But what I do know is that this place was a challenge - and I loved every moment of it.

### Part IV, Chapter 10: Level 37

Hello there! It's great to see you again. I hope you are doing well. Let me tell you about Level 37.

I have been wandering through this level for a while now, and it's definitely one of the more unique places I've ever been to. The architecture is simply mind-bending. The way the walls seem to bend and shift into different shapes and sizes is truly awe-inspiring. And the sound effects! Oh my, the sound effects. From the drip of water in the pool to the roar of machinery in the industrial areas, it's all so surreal.

But, as much as I love wandering around this level, I can't help but feel a little trapped. The only way out is through that dark tunnel leading to Level -132, and I'm not sure I'm ready to face whatever awaits me there. So I keep going back and forth between feeling terrified and feeling like I'm finally finding my footing.

I hope you can relate to some degree. It seems like wandering through a maze is never easy, and it can be incredibly frustrating when you can't seem to find your way out. But sometimes, the journey is more important than the destination. So keep exploring, and if you ever get stuck, don't give up!

### Part V, Chapter 1: Level 0

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on my experiences since my last message.

I have been wandering around Level 0 for a few days now and things have not been going well. The constant changes in linear space and the lack of resources has made it difficult to navigate. However, I have managed to find a few clues that may help me find a way out.

I am still searching for a way to exit Level 0, but in the mean time, I wanted to share some of my experiences. I have found a variety of rooms that are similar to the ones I started out in. Some of these rooms are clean and tidy, while others are filthy and cluttered. The fluorescent lights hum at a constant frequency, and I can walk in a straight line but end up in different locations each time.

I have also discovered that there are entities within Level 0, but I have not encountered any of them yet. It is difficult to navigate the space, as the linear structure changes constantly. However, I am determined to find a way out and I will keep exploring until I do.

Thank you for your thoughts and prayers. I hope to update you soon.

### Part V, Chapter 2: Level 1

Hi,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I'm okay after wandering Level 1 for a few days. However, I don't think I'm going to make it to the surface again. I've been stuck in Level 1 for too long now and I'm starting to lose my mind.

I have some questions that I would really appreciate your help with answering. Specifically, I'm curious about how many people are left on the surface, what kind of life they lead there, and what challenges they face. Would you be able to find me someone who might be willing to talk about their experiences?

Thank you for all the work you've done helping me get through this, and I hope you're doing well.

Best regards,
Jane Doe

### Part V, Chapter 3: Level 2

"I'm still in Level 2. The pipes are constantly leaking and the steam is shot out of them, making it impossible to walk without being cooked alive. I've been wandering around for a few days now, trying to find any way out. There are Facelings and Hounds here, as well as Smilers and Scratchers. I don't have any resources or supplies left, so I'm stuck in here until I can find a way out. I hope someone finds me before it's too late."

### Part VII, Chapter 1: Level 0


I remember getting lost in the maze of Level 0. I wandered aimlessly for what felt like hours until I finally stumbled upon a dark room with an oddly shaped door. I tried to open it, but it wouldn't budge. Suddenly, I heard a faint voice whisper, "You can do this. Just keep moving forward."

I took a deep breath and pushed the door open. A bright light flooded the space beyond, blinding me for a moment. When my eyes adjusted to the light, I saw a large room with a single exit. The air tasted different here - cleaner and fresher. I cautiously stepped out into the next room, which had a familiar feel but was different in some way I couldn't quite put my finger on.

I walked forward, and suddenly, I found myself outside Level 0 again. I looked back at the door and wondered if I should try to navigate back to Level 0. But I didn't know how, and I had no idea what lay beyond that point. So I turned around and started walking in the opposite direction.

For days, I wandered endlessly through Levels 1-27. I knew each location had its own unique challenges and obstacles, but I couldn't quite put my finger on what they were. Sometimes I felt like I was making progress, but other times I felt like I was just spinning my wheels.

But despite the confusion and frustration, I never gave up hope. Every time I thought I had found a solution, something else would come up to throw me off course. But I kept pushing forward, searching for some sort of pattern or clue that would lead me to safety.

Finally, after what felt like an eternity, I stumbled upon a room with a familiar sight - a map. I recognized it from somewhere, but I couldn't quite put my finger on where. I spent hours pouring over the map, trying to decipher its secrets and navigate my way through Levels 1-27.

Finally, after what felt like months of wandering, I made it to Level 27. From there, I could see the exit to The Void just beyond. I ran towards it as fast as I could, pushing aside any obstacles that stood in my way. Finally, I burst through the door and found myself outside again, this time in a familiar place.

I don't know what lies ahead for me now, but I am grateful for the journey I have been on. Despite all the frustration and confusion, I never gave up hope. And even though I may not fully understand what's come before or what's to come next, I know that I will keep moving forward, one step at a time.

### Part VII, Chapter 2: Level 27


There are many different ways to explore Level 27, but the most common is by tearing off the carpeting in the main room and using a knife to cut through the floor. It's not a clear path, but it's one that many wanderers have taken and survived to tell the tale. Others may find their way in through other means, but the best route is one of constant exploration, with each new room being discovered in turn. There are no set paths, so don't be surprised if you encounter a dead end or an unexpected obstacle. The level may be vast, but the sense of discovery is exhilarating.

Description: 
Jeffrey A. Johnson is a white male, 5'9", 160 pounds, with brown hair and hazel eyes. He was last seen wearing a black leather jacket, blue jeans, and black boots. He may be in possession of a silver revolver and may also speak with an accent.

### Part VIII, Chapter 1: Level 0

"I'm not sure how I ended up in Level 0, but I know that I need to find a way out. The hallways are confusing and constantly changing, making it difficult to navigate. The fluorescent lights hum loudly and are impossible to ignore. The air is thick with dust and humidity, making it hard to breathe. I've stumbled upon a variety of rooms so far, but they all look the same. There are no recognizable landmarks or signs of life, which makes me worry that I am lost. 

Despite my frustration, I have found a way to communicate with the other wanderers in Level 0. We use radio signals to send messages across the space. I have been able to find at least one other person wandering around the level, but they are just as lost and confused as me. Our only hope for escape seems to be finding a way out of this level. 

As I wander through Level 0, I keep hoping that I will eventually find a way to leave. Unfortunately, I am not sure where I need to go next or how to get there. The lack of resources and guidance makes it difficult to plan my route, and the constant changes in the hallways make navigation even more challenging. I can only hope that my next step will lead me to safety and escape from this endless, confusing, and dangerous void."

### Part VIII, Chapter 2: Level 1

From Level 1 to Level 2: 
We were walking through a dense fog when suddenly the floor dropped out from under me. I fell into a pool of water that was eerily calm and still. The sound of dripping water echoed through the air, and I could hear strange noises in the distance. I turned around to look around when I heard a voice call out, "Hey! Are you alright?" I realized it was a girl who had stumbled upon me. We exchanged greetings and she asked if I needed any help. I said yes, and we started walking together. She seemed to know her way around, and we soon found ourselves in Level 2.

### Part VIII, Chapter 3: Level 2

Thank you for the update. I'm glad to know that I am still alive and well, although the journey has been quite harrowing. Level 2 was a depressing reminder of my past, but I've persevered through the horrors and am now ready to face whatever lies ahead in Level 4.

### Part VIII, Chapter 4: Level 4


The following message was received from Jeffrey A. Johnson while they were wandering Level 4:

Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am currently in a state of limbo, unsure of what to do next with my life. I have been wandering around Level 4 for quite some time now, and I am hoping someone can help me figure out my next steps. If anyone has any advice or suggestions, please let me know. Thank you for listening.

To: John Doe

Subject: Report from Level 0

Date: August 12, 2019

John Doe,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to give you an update on your situation after exploring Level 0. Please keep in mind that any information or details may not be possible as we are in a non-Euclidean space with altered linear and non-linear spaces. However, I will do my best to provide accurate information.

During your exploration of Level 0, you encountered various entities that could potentially exist within the level. You navigated through the fluid saturated carpet and found various rooms that had different layouts and features. You also discovered that there are multiple ways to exit Level 0, including through walls and other seemingly random locations.

However, you soon realized that the environment was unstable and unpredictable, leading to a lack of resources and navigation challenges. Your dehydration, starvation, and exhaustion became major concerns as you were unable to find an exit or any sources of food or water. You eventually found yourself in Level 1 after breaking through the floor and navigating through other unexpected spaces.

Despite the challenges, you encountered several entities within Level 0, including a group of children who appeared to be lost and disoriented. You provided them with guidance and assistance as they appeared to be searching for their own way out. You also stumbled upon a room that had a strange humming noise and seemed to contain a fluid that was potentially dangerous to consume.

Overall, your exploration of Level 0 was a unique and perilous journey that tested your mental and physical strength. Despite the uncertainty and unpredictability, you persevered and emerged from Level 0 with valuable experiences and memories.

### Part IX, Chapter 2: Level 1

Subject: Update

Hi,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to give you a brief update on my journey through Level 1. Here are some of the highlights:

- I encountered a group of Facelings who tried to attack me. They were really aggressive and wouldn't listen to any of my dialogue options. Eventually, I was able to sneak past them and avoid any conflict.
- I found a hidden area with a bunch of supplies. It was pretty exciting to see that much food and water in one place! Unfortunately, I heard some strange noises and saw some shadows moving around. I'm not sure what that was, but I'll keep an eye on it.
- I encountered a group of Raiders who were looking for me. They were friendly enough, but they had some pretty strict rules about where you could go and what you could do. I'm not sure if I want to join their group or not.
- Overall, Level 1 has been really interesting so far! I can't wait to see what else is in store for me.

### Part IX, Chapter 3: Level 188


Dear Wanderer,

I am writing to you from Level 188. After many days wandering the level, I have made an observation about the architecture and layout of the area. It appears that Level 0 may be connected to this level in some way. I have not been able to determine how or why, but it is clear that there is an entrance/exit point on the opposite side of the level.

I would greatly appreciate any information you may have regarding Level 0 and this connection. Additionally, if you happen to encounter me on your travels, please let me know that you saw me in Level 188. I am currently wandering around in search of a way out of this place.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,

John Doe

### Part XI, Chapter 2: Level -1

Dear all,

I am writing to inform you of my experience while wandering Level -1. I have been wandering the level for several days now, and it seems like there is no end in sight. However, I have noticed something strange. Every time I try to find a way out, I get lost. I can't seem to remember the layout of the level and I constantly get lost. I am not alone in this experience. Many others are facing the same problem. It seems like there is an evil entity lurking in the level, manipulating us and making it difficult to find our way out. I have encountered several instances where I have seen orbs floating in front of me, and they seem to be controlling my movements. I am afraid that I may never escape this level and the entity that is haunting it. Please let me know if you have any suggestions on how to escape this level.

Thank you for your time.

### Part XI, Chapter 3: Level -205

"It's been a week since I left Level -205. The static is still crackling in the air, and I'm starting to feel like I'm losing my mind. I've been wandering aimlessly, trying to find some way out, but there doesn't seem to be any rhyme or reason to this place. 

I keep hearing whispers in the distance, but I can't make out what they're saying. The walls are covered in tangled wires and Death Moths are constantly swarming around me. I thought I was going insane when I saw a reflection of myself walking through a wall, but now I know that it was just another manifestation of the instability here.

I've seen some strange things, like a room filled with mirrors that reflected back the same image, and another where the walls moved as if they were breathing. But I don't have the energy to explore every corner of this place. 

The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that I can find a way out. If I can just make it to Level 0, maybe I can start over again. But for now, I'm just trying to survive."

### Part XI, Chapter 4: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share my experiences in Level 0 so far. It has been a strange and terrifying journey. The first few days were confusing and overwhelming, but I soon realized that navigating the level was like being in a dream. 

The fluorescent lighting hums constantly, making it difficult to focus on anything for more than a few seconds. The rooms are identical in every way, from the wallpaper to the carpet to the lighting fixtures. It's hard to tell where you end and the room begins, as the surfaces are seamless. 

I have encountered no entities so far, but the lack of resources is a huge concern. Food and water are scarce, and I have not been able to find a way out of the level. The lack of light and air make it difficult to navigate, and I have accidentally stumbled upon some dangerous areas several times. 

Despite the challenges, I have encountered some remarkable individuals while wandering Level 0. These strangers have offered me guidance and support, and I am grateful for their company. I will continue to explore the level and hope to find a way out soon. 

Thank you for your love and concern.

John

### Part XI, Chapter 5: Level 13

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I am still alive. The last few days have been a whirlwind of adventure, but I am okay. Please don't worry about me.

I had an experience in Level 13 that I can never forget. There were moments when I felt like I was in a dream, and others where I thought I was truly lost. But I never lost hope. It was only when I saw the opening to Level 13 from a distance that I realized how far I had come.

I must say, it has been quite an experience. The challenges I faced were beyond my imagination, but they made me stronger and more confident. And the people I met along the way...they will remain in my heart forever.

I hope this message finds you well. Please keep me in your thoughts. I will be back soon to share more about my adventure.

Love,

John Doe

To those who have helped me thus far:
I am grateful for your assistance. However, I must continue my journey on my own. I hope that you find the peace and solace you seek.

UPDATE ON THE JOURNEY

It has been several weeks since I last communicated with those who have helped me. I have made my way through the level and out into the unknown. The journey has been challenging, but I have persevered.

I must now make a decision as to where I will go from here. While Level 188 was initially confusing and unsettling, I have come to appreciate its unique architecture and idiosyncrasies. However, I am unsure if I want to continue on this path.

If you are reading this, please know that I am okay. I have not disappeared completely, but I must find my own way now.

Thank you again for your assistance and support.## Part XII

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update on my travels in Level 0. It has been quite the adventure so far. 

I must start by noting that the fluorescent lighting in Level 0 is incredibly disorienting and can cause one to lose track of time. It's difficult to determine how much time has passed when you can only see a few minutes or hours at a time. 

The most common feature in this level are the walls that seem to change color and texture depending on the angle they are viewed from. They may be made of stone, then metal, then wood, then glass, and so on. It's always a little bit confusing.

As for resources, I have been able to find some food and water, but there seems to be no way to sustain oneself beyond these basic needs. The air is thick with dust and it's difficult to breathe, which can cause headaches and dizziness. 

The lack of available resources has made navigation quite challenging. It's easy to get lost in Level 0 and it's unclear where the exit is located. It's been a while since I last saw a map or compass, so I don't know how far I have wandered from my starting point. 

I have encountered some entities in this level, but they are difficult to detect as they blend into the environment and their presence cannot be sensed with standard equipment. I have seen some strange shapes and patterns in the walls that may indicate the presence of other beings, but I cannot confirm it.

Overall, exploring Level 0 has been an adventure worth experiencing. It's a unique and unpredictable experience that can be both thrilling and terrifying at the same time. I hope to continue my journey soon and find my way out.

It has been five days since Sarah Smith disappeared. The investigation is still ongoing, and the family is seeking any information that may help locate her. As a volunteer search party, they have been searching for Sarah in Level -1. However, they have yet to find any leads. It's been days of searching the level, and they're starting to lose hope.

### Part XV, Chapter 1: Level 0



As I wandered through Level 0, I noticed that the walls were made of a strange material. It was not stone, metal, or even plastic; it seemed to be some sort of composite material that could change shape and texture depending on how it was viewed. I tried to follow a set of stairs that led downwards, but they were covered in a shimmering liquid that glowed softly in the darkness. As I reached the bottom, I found a room filled with books. They were not just any books, but ancient tomes written in languages I had never heard before. As I looked over them, a strange feeling washed over me and I began to read. The words seemed to come alive, as if they were speaking directly to me. I could feel the history and wisdom of these books, and I knew that I had stumbled upon something great. I left Level 0 with a newfound appreciation for knowledge and a desire to explore more of this mysterious place.

### Part XVI, Chapter 2: Level 1

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some of my experiences while wandering around Level 1. It's been quite a journey, and I thought I'd share some of the highlights.

First, let me tell you about the Facelings. They are a group of creatures that seem to have taken over the area around Level 102. They are aggressive and don't like to be disturbed. It's best to avoid them if possible.

Next, I wanted to mention the Dullers. They are another group of creatures that seem to be on a mission to clean up the backrooms. They use a special gas to make everything look shiny and new. They are not friendly and will attack anyone who gets in their way.

Finally, let me tell you about the Skin-Stealers. These creatures are known for stealing other creatures' skin and turning them into themselves. It's a strange and disturbing process. I hope I don't have to experience it firsthand.

Overall, Level 1 has been quite an adventure. I've met some amazing people along the way, and I'm grateful for their help. If you ever find yourself in this area again, let me know. I might be able to give you some tips on how to avoid the dangerous creatures.

### Part XVI, Chapter 3: Level 188

It's been a month since I disappeared. I'm still in Level 188, but the place has changed a lot. The windows that led me to other locations are now locked, and the rooms behind them have changed. It's like entering a different world every time I try to explore. The only way out is through those windows. The Peripherals still follow me, but they seem to be less noticeable now. I hope I find my way out soon and can return home.## Part XVII

### Part XVIII, Chapter 3: Level 14

I've been wandering Level 14 for hours. It's a maze of hallways and rooms, with no clear way out. I keep finding doors that lead to dead ends, and I don't know how to get through them. Every so often, I see doctors or nurses, but they ignore me and keep working.

I keep seeing ghosts around me, but they don't seem to affect me in any way. They just seem to be waiting for someone else to notice them. I hope I can find a way out of this place before I start hallucinating.

Date: August 31, 2016

As I continued wandering around Level 0, I found myself getting more and more lost. The walls seemed to change every few steps, and the fluorescent lighting was making me feel like I was hallucinating. Despite my attempts at navigating the level, I found myself unable to locate a way out.

As I walked further into Level 0, I came across a room with what appeared to be a bed. I decided to take a nap, hoping that the level would eventually start to look more familiar. After several hours of wandering and trying to find a way out, I finally stumbled upon a door.

Pushing through the door revealed a staircase leading downwards. I followed the stairs and soon found myself in Level 13. Although this level looked completely different than Level 0, I felt relieved to be able to move on from my previous experiences. As I navigated my way through Level 13, I encountered several entities that seemed to be trying to communicate with me. Eventually, I managed to find a way out of the level and into The Void.

Overall, my journey through Level 0 was a challenging and terrifying experience. However, I am glad to have had the opportunity to explore such an unique and complex location.

### Part XXI, Chapter 2: Level 1

Dear friends and loved ones,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experiences in Level 1 since the last time I communicated with you. As you know, I have been wandering around for a few days now. The first few days were challenging as I had no idea where to go or what to do. But as I explored, I found a small group of people who were friendly and helpful. They offered me food, water, and shelter, which was greatly appreciated.

Overall, Level 1 is a vast and complex place. There are many different factions and groups, each with their own rules and way of doing things. It can be difficult to navigate and keep track of everything going on around you. But with the help of these kind people, I have been able to find my way around and make some new friends.

I have also been exploring some of the darker areas of Level 1, where strange and dangerous creatures lurk. These encounters have been quite scary but also exhilarating, as I have been able to face my fears and push myself to new limits.

I have not been able to leave Level 1 yet, as I am still searching for something that seems important to me. But I hope to soon be able to continue my journey and see what else this strange place has in store for me.

Thank you again for your love and support during these past few days. Without you and these wonderful people, I would not have been able to survive this long in such a dangerous and confusing environment.

Joyce James

Greetings,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on my whereabouts since my last contact. I have been wandering Level 188 for quite some time now. It has been a long and eventful journey, filled with countless encounters and experiences. The journey has taught me many things, including the importance of taking care of one's self and others around you.

I have encountered several entities along the way, some friendly and some not so much. I have also explored many areas within Level 188, including the Hub, a place that holds many secrets and wonders. It has been quite the adventure, and I am grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this incredible world.

I would like to express my gratitude to those who have helped me along the way. Whether it was providing food and water, offering shelter or simply being there to listen, your kindness and generosity have meant the world to me.

I hope to continue my journey and explore more of Level 188 soon. Thank you for keeping in touch.

Sincerely,
Jonathan Markham

### Part XXII, Chapter 3: Level 188

It's been a while since I last posted. Let me tell you about Level 188. It's an enclosed building with architecture similar to a hotel. There are several windows in the center of the level that offer different views. Many of these windows are obscured by curtains, but some may become visible at random times. Once you enter a room with an open window, it will be locked and you won't be able to enter. However, if you open the curtains in a room with a closed window, then you can enter the room without any problem. I should know, because I've done it twice. The Windows are really creepy. In some cases, certain windows may disappear and reappear suddenly, displaying different locations. The Peripherals are also present in this level, and they don't seem to have a physical form. They only appear as one being, but you might see multiple of them in your peripheral vision. Don't worry, I haven't encountered any hostile entities yet.## Part XXIII

### Part XXIII, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Message from Marcus Smith

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and let you know that I am okay. After wandering for a while in Level 0, I found myself at the edge of the level. As I looked down, I saw a strange glow coming from one of the walls. I cautiously approached the wall and discovered an opening. I crawled through the opening and found myself on Level 13.

I must say, Level 13 is quite different from Level 0. The surroundings are vast and open, with towering mountains and vast plains stretching out as far as the eye can see. The air is cooler and fresher, and the sunlight filtering through the clouds feels warm and comforting. I have been wandering for a few days now, and I must say, I am enjoying myself.

However, I must also be aware that there are dangers lurking in Level 13. There are creatures that roam around and attack anyone who comes their way. It is important to be cautious and keep an eye out for any danger signs. If you hear of any news about me, please let me know.

Thank you for your time.

### Part XXIII, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear All,

I hope this message finds you well. As many of you may know, I have been wandering through Level 13 for quite some time now. It has been a very long and tiring journey, but I am still determined to find my way back home.

I have encountered many strange things on my journey, including a room that shifts dimensions at random times, and an area where the floor is made of a strange, jelly-like substance that gives me a headache just by standing in it for too long. However, the most memorable experience I have had was when I found myself trapped in a seemingly endless hallway with no way out.

As I walked down the hall, I noticed that the walls were covered in strange markings and symbols that seemed to shift and move as I looked at them. Suddenly, I heard a voice calling out to me from behind one of the walls. It was an old man with a raspy voice who asked me how I was doing. I explained my situation to him, and he offered me his hand, saying that he could help me escape.

I took his hand and followed him through the wall, finding myself in a different area of Level 13. The place looked exactly like it did before, but something felt different. As we walked further into the area, I noticed a strange light emanating from a nearby room. It was as if the entire level was alive, with strange creatures moving around us.

We entered the room and found ourselves face to face with a creature made entirely of water. Its eyes glowed in the darkness, and it spoke to us in a language I had never heard before. The old man translated for me, telling me that the creature was a protector of Level 13 and had helped him before.

We spent some time with the creature, and eventually left it alone. We continued on our journey until we found ourselves at the entrance to Level 909. I took a deep breath and stepped out into the unknown world beyond Level 13.

I have no idea how long my journey will be or where it will take me next, but I am grateful for the experience and the people who have helped me along the way. Thank you all for your support and understanding.

Sincerely,
Marcus Smith.

### Part XXIII, Chapter 3: Level 909

To those of you reading this, I hope you can understand the severity of my situation. I am currently lost in Level 909 and have not been able to find a way out. I have been wandering around for several days and am beginning to lose hope. However, I want to assure you that I am still alive and fighting. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers, and let me know if you happen to come across any clues or leads that could help me escape. Thank you for your kindness.

### Part XXIV, Chapter 3: Level 2

From: Jane Knox

Subject: Update on wandering Level 2

Date: June 30, 2017

I am writing to provide an update on my experience in Level 2. After spending several days wandering the level, I encountered a Faceling entity. It was aggressive and attacked me, causing significant damage to my body. I managed to escape from it by running as fast as possible and seeking shelter in an abandoned office nearby.

From there, I found an unlocked fire exit and made my way out of the building. I continued wandering Level 2 until I came across a Smiler entity. It attacked me, causing significant damage to my body once again. I managed to escape from it by running as fast as possible and seeking shelter in an abandoned maintenance room nearby.

In total, I spent several days wandering the level and encountered two entities: Faceling and Smiler. The level is incredibly dangerous and I would not recommend attempting to explore it under any circumstances. If you come across either of these entities, do not engage with them as they are extremely hostile and can cause severe damage to one's health.

### Part XXV, Chapter 2: Level 13

Subject: Re: Experiences in Level 13

Hello, John. I hope you are doing well. I received your message from Level 13 and was curious to hear your experiences. 

I remember when we first entered Level 13, it was quite eerie. The floor was covered with something that made a strange creaking sound whenever we walked on it. We tried to avoid it as much as possible. We also saw some unusual plants and flowers that seemed to be growing out of the walls.

As we explored further, we came across a room filled with various machines and devices. One machine caught our attention as it had a screen that showed us our current location in Level 13. We were curious about where we were and what was around us. We decided to take a closer look.

As we approached the machine, the screen showed us a strange landscape filled with clouds and otherworldly creatures. We realized we were somewhere else entirely. We quickly ran towards the exit but found ourselves in Level 10 instead. Panic set in as we realized we had been transported to another level altogether.

From there, things got stranger. We saw strange creatures moving around us that we couldn't quite identify. We stumbled upon a room with a giant hole in the ceiling that led to Level 996. Without hesitation, we jumped through the hole and found ourselves in a completely different part of the level.

We were amazed by what we saw. The space was filled with colorful lights and strange creatures that seemed to be communicating with each other. We spent some time exploring this new area before deciding to return to Level 10.

On our way back, we encountered a group of people who had been stuck in Level 996 for what felt like days. They described hearing strange noises and feeling lost. We offered them our help and together, we managed to escape the level.

It was a long journey, but we made it out alive. Now back on Level 10, we hope to find a way back home. Thank you for your message, John. It means a lot to us.

### Part XXV, Chapter 3: Level 996

Subject: Update

Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I have been wandering around Level 0 for a while now, and I wanted to give you an update on my experiences in the City.

Firstly, I must say that the white plains are quite unsettling. The only difference between the City and the Building is the color of the sky, and it changes every few minutes. I have seen a lot of buildings that look like they belong in Level 11, but with different materials like rubber, metal, and bricks.

Secondly, I have encountered some entities. However, they appear to be Insanity-like creatures and cannot harm me. I have seen some Chinatowns that are quite beautiful, and one in particular located in the City.

Thirdly, I have discovered some Entrances and Exits. Locations in Level -69 might lead to Level 996 which can be identified by glitchy pieces of furniture completely painted white; a room resembling a mental hospital in Level 799 will lead one to Level 996. Noclipping through walls painted white in Level 549 and jumping into a television with its monitor showing a white screen in Level 954 will frequently lead one to Level 996. Areas within Level 13 may perhaps instantly send one to Level 700.

Lastly, I have encountered some strange objects that are entirely white. They are impossible to avoid, and they might cause harm to my health. However, I have not been affected by them so far.

I hope this message finds you well. Stay safe and keep exploring the City!

Best regards,
John Doe

Yesterday, I stumbled upon a hidden door that led me to Level -1. It was dark, and scary, but I made it through okay. There were some strange creatures there that made me feel uneasy, but I managed to stay calm and continue exploring. I hope to find a way back to Level 0 soon. Keep me in your thoughts."

The following message was received from John Doe while they were wandering Level -1. It describes their experiences up until they exited to Level -9.

### Part XXV, Chapter 6: Level -9

Dear U12,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some thoughts I've had while wandering Level -9 for the past few days. It's been quite a journey, and I thought I'd share my experiences with you.

The first few days were surreal. The desolate cityscape was eerie, but also oddly peaceful. The snowfall was beautiful, and it felt like I was wandering through a winter wonderland. But as the days went on, things took a turn for the worse. The landscape started to shift, and buildings began to appear that I'd never seen before. The streets became darker, and the city seemed to be crumbling. It's not exactly clear what's happening here, but it's definitely not safe.

As I continued wandering, I stumbled upon a few strange things. There was a Red Lamp that transported me to Level -1, where I met a mysterious figure who hinted at something big happening in Level -92. I also found an abandoned castle in the middle of the city, and entered it to find a level portrayed inside. The level felt eerie and unsettling, with strange noises echoing through the halls.

Despite the odd sights and sounds, I can't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement about this experience. It's been a wild ride, and I can't wait to see what else is in store for me in Level -8. Thank you for listening, U12.

Sincerely,
John Doe

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on my disappearance. As of now, we have been wandering around Level -8 for almost a week and have been trying to find any way out. We were not able to exit the mountain range and are currently stuck in Level 10.

I am doing fine physically, but I miss my family and friends. I am hoping that you would keep me in your thoughts until we can return back home.

Thank you for your attention.

Sincerely,
John Doe

Addendum:

### Part XXVIII, Chapter 3: Level 1

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give you a brief update on my travels through Level 1. It has been a harrowing experience, to say the least, but I have persevered.

I have encountered many strange and terrifying entities in this level. The Facelings, Dullers, and Scratchers are just some of the groups that have taken up residence here. Their behavior is unpredictable and often dangerous. It's not uncommon for them to attack without warning or provocation.

Despite these challenges, I have also encountered some kind and generous people who have provided me with food, water, and a place to stay. They have shared their stories with me and offered me guidance on how to survive in this strange and dangerous world.

I am still searching for other survivors and any information on the location of Level 2. I would greatly appreciate any help or support you could offer me in my journey. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers.

Sincerely,
Jane Doe

### Part XXVIII, Chapter 4: Level 2

As I walked further into Level 2, the heat became unbearable. The pipes were constantly leaking steam, and I could feel my skin being cooked off. The Facelings and Hounds were everywhere, and I could hear the Smilers' whispers echoing through the hallways.

I soon realized that there was no way out of Level 2. The only other entrance was by entering an elevator in an office-style building. However, I was told that the doors were locked, and I had to find a specific key to unlock them. After searching for it for some time, I found the key and used it to exit Level 2.

As I left Level 2, I could hear the sound of a fire alarm. I quickly ran towards the source and found a fire exit that led me to Level 3. From there, I could see the entrance to Level 4. I made my way through the building and found the entrance to Level 4.

As I walked into Level 4, I could hear the sound of someone crying. I followed the sound until I found a room with a crying person in it. It was a girl who had lost her parents in the steam pipes. I offered to help her, but she refused and ran away.

I continued walking through Level 4 until I found a large office with a computer console. I used my phone to search for information about Level 3 and Level 2. The computer showed me that there was another way out of Level 2 - a stairwell in Level 1. I quickly ran back to Level 2 and found the stairs.

As I started climbing the stairs, I heard more whispers from Smilers. But I didn't let them distract me. I made it to the top of the stairs and saw the exit to Level 3. I quickly ran towards it and found a locked door. I used a keycard I had with me to unlock it and left Level 2 for good.

### Part XXIX, Chapter 1: Level 0

From Level 0
To Level 13
It was a long and tiring journey. My feet felt like they were weighed down by lead blocks, and I couldn't move an inch without feeling the weight of the world pressing down on me. The journey seemed endless as I stumbled forward, my body aching with every step.

I saw many strange things along the way. A room filled with hundreds of identical doors, all leading to different places. A room filled with nothing but a single bookshelf, and a message written on it that read "The world outside is madness". But as I kept moving, I couldn't help but feel grateful for the few moments of respite that came with passing through these rooms.

As I continued on my journey, I found myself facing challenges that seemed insurmountable. The walls were closing in around me, and I could hear a faint humming in the distance. But I couldn't let my fear take over, so I kept moving forward, step by step.

Eventually, after what felt like an eternity, I burst through a wall and found myself outside Level 13. I looked up at the sky and saw a beautiful rainbow. It was a moment of clarity that reminded me why I had been wandering in the first place.

With that thought in mind, I continued on my journey and eventually found myself back in my starting room. I sat down for a moment, taking in the weight of what I had just accomplished. And then, with a deep breath, I began to explore the world around me once more.

### Part XXIX, Chapter 2: Level 13


Jeffrey R. Smith

Level 13

I can't believe I did this. I remember waking up in a strange place, unsure of how I got there. The floor was uneven and I felt a sense of unease. Suddenly, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a woman with long hair, wearing a black dress. She looked like she was in a hurry. I tried to follow her but she disappeared into an opening in the wall. Suddenly, I found myself on Level 13. The place felt strange and unfamiliar. I walked around for a while, taking in my surroundings. Then, I saw a door that led outside. I tried to open it but it was locked. I looked around and saw a group of people gathered near the door. They were talking about me. I didn't know what they were saying but I knew I had to get out. I ran towards the door and opened it. Suddenly, I felt a gust of wind. The door slammed shut, trapping me inside. The room spun around me and I saw nothing but darkness. I tried to stand up but my body wouldn't move. I realized I was stuck in Level 13 forever.

### Part XXIX, Chapter 3: Level 1

Message from Jeffrey R. Smith
I'm sorry to hear about my disappearance in Level 1. I was wandering around the area near L and 16th Street NW in Washington DC on October 27th, 2019 at around 8:00 PM. I have been wandering around Level 1 for a few hours now and it feels like an eternity. I'm not sure what to do next. I'm hoping someone will see this message and be able to help me find my way out of the Backrooms.

### Part XXIX, Chapter 4: Level 2

Subject: Message from Jeffrey R. Smith

### Part XXX, Chapter 1: Level 0

HELLO FROM LEVEL 27

Hello,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you from Level 27 of the Backrooms. It has been several weeks since I last wrote to you, and I have been wandering around this level a lot. I wanted to share some information about what it's like to be here.

LEVEL 27 IS NOT LIKE LEVELS 1-3 OR 0

I understand that you may be confused about why I would write to you from Level 27 when the Backrooms looks exactly like the other levels, but Level 27 is very different. There are no walls or barriers separating it from Level 0, and there are no other levels beyond this one. The environment here is completely different, and it can be challenging to navigate.

WHEN I WANDERED IN LEVEL 0, I FOUND NOTHING

When I first entered the Backrooms, I found a building that looked like a commercial space. There were worn-out wallpaper, old carpets, and scattered electrical outlets scattered throughout. The fluorescent lighting hummed constantly, and the air was thick with dust. It felt desolate and eerie.

WHEN I WANDERED IN LEVEL 0, THE FLOORING CHANGED

As I wandered deeper into Level 0, the flooring changed. There were no walls or barriers blocking my progress, but the environment looked completely different. The surface of the flooring was different every few steps, and there was a constant humming sound that made it difficult to focus on anything else. It's hard to describe without experiencing it firsthand, but it feels like you're walking through a dream.

I FOUND A RIVER IN LEVEL 0

One day, while wandering around Level 0, I stumbled upon a river. The water was thick and viscous, and there were no visible outlets or sources of water. As I walked along the river, I saw that it led to a dark space above the ceiling tiles, roughly one meter in height. Inside this space, I found a room with scattered debris and a buzzing hum. I'm not sure what's in there, but I hope someone else has managed to find their way out.

I FOUND A WAY OUT OF LEVEL 0

Despite the challenges of navigating Level 0, I eventually found a way out. There was a set of stairs leading up to a large exit sign that glowed with an eerie blue light. I climbed these stairs and exited the level. While it's not the easiest way to get out, at least I finally made it out alive!

Thank you for taking the time to read this message from Level 27. If you have any questions or would like more information, please let me know.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 1: Level 0



### Part XXXI, Chapter 2: Level 13

To the Main Author and anyone who may have helped in this investigation:

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give my sincerest gratitude for all your hard work and dedication in uncovering the truth about my disappearance. As you know, my case has been a long and arduous journey, but with your help and support, I have finally found my way back home.

I wanted to share with you some insights and details of my experience at Level 13 that I thought were worth noting. Perhaps it would be helpful in piecing together the puzzle and finding any missing people who may have gone through similar experiences.

To begin with, I must say that the atmosphere within was eerily unsettling. The floor was unstable, with odd textures that made it feel like we were walking on a moving canvas. It was as if the space was constantly shifting beneath our feet, causing us to lose our footing and balance. We were not alone in this room either; there were other unseen entities around us, some of which seemed benign while others were downright malevolent.

As we ventured further into the level, the situation took a turn for the worse. Suddenly, I found myself trapped in a narrow alleyway with no way out. The walls were closing in on me, and I could hear the floor below me shifting. Panic set in as I realized that I was in grave danger. But then, something unexpected happened. A sudden gust of wind blew through the alleyway, pushing me up against the wall and carrying me away from the danger zone.

I awoke to find myself outside Level 13, with no memory of what had happened. As I looked around, I saw that the building was abandoned, and it appeared as if it had been there for years. The only indication that anyone had ever been inside was a note on a nearby bulletin board: "If you're reading this, it's already too late."

I know that this message may seem cryptic, but I can assure you that it holds some significance. Perhaps it's a warning of the danger that awaits those who dabble in Level 13 or some other unknown place. Or maybe it's a clue to my own experience within. Who knows?

Anyway, I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for your time and effort in bringing closure to my case. If there is anything else I can do to help, please don't hesitate to reach out.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 3: Level -13

The following is a message received from John Smith while they were wandering Level -13. They describe their experiences up until they exited to Level 10.

MESSAGE: Thank you for your help, but I have to go now. Level 10 is calling me. It's like another world. The trees are so tall and the air is thick. But there's something in the distance that looks familiar. I can see a light. It's like a beacon of hope. I'll come back soon, I promise.

[REDACTED]: Goodbye, John. Stay safe.

[REDACTED]: (sighs) I cant believe you saw that. But remember to keep your head down and stay inside the perimeter.

SIMMONS: Stay safe, John. You're a hero.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 4: Level 10

To the government and anyone who may read this:
I am begging for help. I am lost in Level 10, and I have been wandering aimlessly for days. My family and friends are worried about me, and I need to find a way out. Please help me.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 5: Level 35

I've been wandering Level 35 for hours now. I don't know where it is, and the only way out seems to be the one that leads to the next level. I keep getting lost and can't find a way out. I hope I find my way back home soon.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 6: Level 13

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. As you may recall, I was last seen on Level 13 and have been wandering around for a few days now. I thought I'd reach out to you all to see if anyone has any information on my whereabouts or if there are any leads on finding me.

I'm currently stuck in a room with a bunch of strange creatures that seem to be able to control time and space. It's quite an experience, but I'm trying to stay positive and keep moving forward.

If you can help me out, please do. I'd appreciate any assistance you could provide. Thank you all for your love, support, and guidance throughout this journey.

John.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 7: Level 14

To those who may stumble upon this message, I am writing to provide an update on my time wandering Level 14. As you may recall, I was last seen on the 20th of December 2019 in San Francisco, California. Since then, I have wandered for over a year and have encountered some truly bizarre experiences. While I cannot speak for others, I will share my journey so far.

I have encountered a colony of doctors who have been trapped in Level 14 since the early 20th century. They have been guiding me to exits for years, but I always end up back here. I have also found an abandoned hospital on Level -2, which was once a military facility from the 1800s. The hospital is now infested with ghosts, including some that are seemingly alive and functional.

I have encountered a few outposts along the way, but they were all deserted and abandoned. I have also had run-ins with strange creatures that seem to haunt the halls of Level 14. One day, I stumbled upon a group of travelers who had stumbled across this message while wandering through a forest. They gave me a free lab coat and some first-aid supplies to avoid suspicion from the doctors in Level 14.

I am still wandering Level 14 and will continue to do so until I can find a way out. If anyone has any information about my current location, please share it with me. Thank you for your time and consideration.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 8: Level -2


"I don't know how long I've been wandering Level -2, but it feels like an eternity. The only thing I can think about is the fact that I have no idea where to go next. I keep wandering around, hoping that I will eventually find a way out of here. 

But every time I get close, I find something strange or scary that makes me want to give up. Just yesterday, I found a group of Screamers near the exit. They were making a racket and it felt like they were following me. I tried to fight them off, but they just laughed at me and kept on making noise. 

I don't know what I'm going to do. I might have to keep wandering around until I find something that can help me get out of here."

### Part XXXI, Chapter 10: Level 17

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm sorry to hear that you haven't been found yet. I would like to inform you that I have found Level 17 and made it out alive. However, I must warn you that the journey there was quite perilous.

The first thing that struck me was the state of the level. It was like nothing had ever been there before. The floors were covered in water, and the walls looked like they were made of stone. I soon discovered that the level was floating on a large ship, which seemed to be making its way through the levels.

As I continued exploring, I found the cargo ship that I had heard about. It was no longer in one piece, but it still had some of its original features. I managed to get onboard and found myself in a completely different environment. It was like being transported to another world entirely.

I must say, Level 17 is quite the adventure. The journey there may have been rough, but it was worth it to see what was waiting for me. I will always be grateful for the experience.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]

### Part XXXI, Chapter 11: Level 20

"I'm sorry to hear about the Entity attack in Level 19," said a voice from behind me. "I remember that happening, but I guess you didn't know what happened. It's been a while since I've seen someone wandering around this level."

I turned around and saw a familiar face. It was the person who had given me directions to Level 9 earlier in the day.

"Hey," they said, "did you hear about the new entrance to Level 20? I found it by following a few crates."

I nodded and followed them as they led me through a series of empty rooms until we reached a door labeled "Exit." Without hesitation, I opened it and found myself in a different part of Level 20.1.

"Wow," I said. "This level's got some hidden gems if you know where to look."

The person smiled and handed me a map that showed the location of a nearby forklift. "That's a great idea," they said. "Just make sure to keep an eye on the time, and you might be able to explore for a few days at a time."

I thanked them and followed the map, finding myself back in Level 20 where I began my wandering adventure. From there, I continued on until I found myself at the edge of the level looking down at all the other levels from above. It was exhilarating to see everything spread out before me, but it also left me feeling a bit lost and unsure what to do next.

As I gazed out at the different levels, a thought occurred to me: "I wonder if there's a way back home." 

I decided to explore a bit more before heading back to Level 20.1 and seeing what other adventures it might hold.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 12: Level 20.1

From Level 20:
Upon exiting Level 20, John Smith found themselves in a desolate wasteland. The sky was gray, and the air was thick with an ominous mist that seemed to shimmer with an unknown energy. The ground beneath his feet felt strange, as if it was not entirely solid. He had no idea how he got there or how he was able to leave.

As he wandered through this new world, he realized that he was not alone. Strange creatures were moving about him, some appearing to be like animals and others humanoid in form. John could only see them as shadows, and he was unsure if they were friendly or hostile.

He tried to find a way out but found himself lost in this new world. His sense of direction was gone, and he did not know how to navigate this environment. As the days passed, he became increasingly disoriented and began to wonder if he would ever escape.

---

The following message was received from John Smith after they exited Level 20 and found themselves in Level 0. They describe their experiences since then.

From Level 0:
After emerging from Level 20, John Smith felt a sense of clarity wash over him. The world around him seemed familiar, but he could not place his finger on what it was. He had no idea where he was or how he got there. 

As he walked through this new world, he began to notice something strange happening to him. His sense of time and space were stretched out of shape. The days and nights blurred together, and he could not tell if it was morning or night. As he walked, he stumbled upon a group of humans who appeared to be in a state of confusion and disarray.

They were like no humans John had ever seen before. They had strange markings on their skin, and their eyes glowed with an otherworldly light. They did not speak the same language as him, but they could communicate through gestures and symbols.

John approached them cautiously, unsure if he was friend or foe. To his surprise, they welcomed him warmly and offered to guide him through this new world. They showed him how to navigate through Level 0, and he learned that he was not alone in this world. There were others like him, creatures who had been stranded here for years.

Together, they set out to find a way to Level 10, where they hoped to find answers about their current situation. It would be a long journey, but John was determined to see it through.

### Part XXXI, Chapter 13: Level 0

Thank you for the report. Unfortunately, I cannot provide any updates as I have been wandering Level 0 for approximately 10 years now and have not seen anything in this area. If you have any further information, please contact the authorities or a nearby aid station.

### Part XXXIII, Chapter 2: Level 13

John Doe

I have been wandering Level 13 for a few hours now, and the experience has been surreal. The floor beneath my feet is shifting and quivering, causing me to lose my balance and fall through the floor. I've encountered various obstacles, including an unstable floor that gives way beneath my weight, causing me to tumble down a chasm. But despite these challenges, I continue on, searching for a way out.

### Part XXXIII, Chapter 3: Level 14

To all wanderers:

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to give an update on my experiences while wandering Level 14. As of now, I have been here for over a month and have been through many adventures. Despite the challenges, Level 14 has become my home. 

I have encountered many ghosts, but I have not been harmed by them. In fact, they have become friendly and offer to guide me to the exits when I get lost. I have also explored the hospital's underground tunnels and discovered strange landscapes beyond Level 16. 

However, I am worried about the state of Level 16. I have seen many wanderers who were caught in between the two levels, and they never made it to Level 17 as instructed. I believe that someone needs to keep an eye on the situation and offer assistance to those trapped in Level 16. 

I encourage all wanderers to stay safe while exploring Level 14 and Level 16. If you encounter any ghosts or lost wanderers, do not disturb them. Offer assistance, and they will guide you back to the exits.

### Part XXXIII, Chapter 4: Level 16

John Doe,

I have been wandering Level 16 for several days now. It is a very dangerous place and I am struggling to survive. I have encountered hostile Facelings and Insanities on my journey. However, I have managed to find a way out of the level by going through a ventshaft that led me to Level 16.0. I am currently exploring Level 16.0 in hopes of finding a way back to Level 14 or a way to safety. If you are reading this, please do not give up on me. I need your help and support to survive in this dangerous place.

Sincerely,

John Doe

### Part XXXV, Chapter 1: Level 0

Message received from Jessica Jane Smith while wandering Level 0.

Date: December 1, 2020

I don't know how long I have been wandering around here, but I can't seem to find a way out. The walls are made of those same yellowish-brown paper that was on the ceiling in normal reality. The floors are covered in that same old carpet that's never quite the same color. The lights are all different, some flickering and humming at different frequencies.

I keep finding myself in the same rooms over and over again, but with slightly different layouts each time. It's like I'm always at the same point in a maze, but with a different map every time. And every time I try to navigate this place, it feels like I'm getting lost more and more.

I keep hearing that there are other levels beyond this one, but I can't seem to find them. I've tried going out of bounds, breaking walls, and even trying to escape through the floor - nothing works. And every time I try to find a way out, I just end up back in Level 0.

I know that there must be someone or something out there that can help me, but I haven't found anything yet. I'm scared, alone, and stuck in here forever. Please let me out - anywhere would do.

### Part XXXV, Chapter 2: Level -1



---

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give an update on my current situation. After wandering for several days in Level -1, I finally found a way out. However, it was not without danger and peril. I must say, the experience has been quite surreal. The levels are eerily similar, yet completely different. It's as if they merged, but not entirely.

I have encountered many strange sights and sounds, some of which were truly unsettling. I have also learned a bit about the backrooms in general and how they connect to other negative levels. It's fascinating to say the least.

I must admit, I am still struggling with finding my way around Level -2. The layout is quite different from Level -1, but I have managed to find a few clues that may lead me to safety. I have also discovered an entrance to The Void, which is an entirely new negative level. It's vast and eerie, and I cannot wait to explore it further.

I understand if you need to hear from me no more. Please know that I am okay and doing my best to stay alive. Thank you for your love and support.

Sincerely,
Jessica Jane Smith

### Part XXXV, Chapter 3: Level -2


I am writing to provide you with an update on my whereabouts. I have been wandering Level -2 for what feels like an eternity now, and I have lost all sense of time. The hedges are incredibly strong here, and it is extremely difficult to move them out of the way. However, I have found a path that leads to Level -3, which has proven to be quite fruitful so far. I have seen strange things in Level -2, including machines that seem to move around on their own. I am hoping that this path takes me to safety soon, but I cannot say for sure. I will keep you updated as to my progress.

### Part XXXV, Chapter 4: Level -3

To the wanderer who stumbled upon this message,

I am writing to give an update on my experiences in Level -3. Despite being lost for days and wandering around aimlessly, I have finally found a way out. I have managed to exit the level through a rare mirror and have made it to Level 4. However, I must warn you that the journey has been arduous, and I am still struggling to adjust to the world outside of Level -3. I urge you to keep an eye on me as I navigate through this new environment.

Thank you for your help and support.

Subject: Message from Jessica Jane Smith in Level 3

I'm sorry to hear that you're trying to find me. I'm still wandering around Level 3 and haven't found a way out yet. But I wanted to share my experiences from the last few days.

First of all, I found a room with a sign saying "Exit Here" written on it. It led me to Level 4. From there, I found a door marked with a picture of a cat. The room beyond that door had a sign saying "Welcome to Level 273." I'm still trying to figure out how to get out of this place.

I've also been wandering around the halls where I saw strange things that made me feel uneasy. There were pipes lined with shiny metal, and I found a room with no doors but one. The other room had a sign saying "You are now entering the office sector." I went in and found a room with a map of some sort. I'm still trying to figure out what it is and where I should go next.

I hope you can find me soon. Please keep looking for me.

### Part XXXV, Chapter 6: Level 4

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I am still wandering around Level 4, but things have been quite busy lately. I have been staying in a small village near the center of the level. The villagers there have been very kind to me and have helped me find resources to survive my time here.

I wanted to share some updates about my situation. I have been trying to find a way out of Level 4, but have not had any luck yet. I am constantly searching for information on the outside world, but it seems like there is no possibility of escape. The level feels so large and overwhelming, but I am determined to find a way.

I have also been exploring the level's hidden areas, which has been quite an adventure. There are many hidden places that hold mysteries waiting to be uncovered. I have been keeping a log of my journey, documenting everything I see and experience. It is important to me to keep track of my experiences, as they may one day help someone else in need.

I would like to thank everyone who has been supporting me during this time. Your messages and kindness have helped me stay positive and motivated. I look forward to hearing from you all again soon.

Sincerely,

Jessica Jane Smith

Messages from Level 13

I must have stumbled into a parallel universe. This is not Level 0 but rather a different dimension entirely. The walls are made of glass and I can see the outside world through them. It's strange to think that this could be real life, but it's also quite scary. I'm glad to be out of here and back in familiar territory.

### Part XXXVII, Chapter 2: Level -1


Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I know it's been a while since I last wrote to you all. It's been quite some time since my last message. The journey has been long and tiring, but I am still alive and kicking. I have been wandering Level -1 for quite some time now. The journey has been long, and I have encountered many obstacles. However, I have never given up. I have kept moving forward, hoping to find a way out.

I have been exploring the labyrinthine corridors of Level -1, searching for any clues that might lead me to a way out. I have encountered many strange creatures, including The Thing, which has been terrorizing Level -7. However, I have never given up hope. I keep moving forward, trying to find a way out.

I have been fortunate enough to find some other wanderers who have joined me on my journey. We have formed a small community, and we have been helping each other along the way. We have shared our experiences, and we have been able to lend a helping hand to those in need.

However, I must admit that the journey has become increasingly challenging. The barriers that separated Level -1 from Level -2 have shattered, and Level -2 and Level -3 are now connected. The levels are now merged, and it's difficult to determine which is which. But I am determined to find a way out.

I hope this message finds you well. Stay safe, and don't give up hope.

"Hello, I'm back. The journey through Level -205 was a wild one. I encountered a lot of strange things that I never thought existed. The rooms were infested with Death Moths and the wires emitted an abnormal amount of electricity. It felt like everything was going to consume the rest. But I made it out alive, and I'm happy to report that I have seen some newfound discoveries. I hope everyone else is doing well. Marielle x"

Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I'm writing from Level 27, where I am currently wandering around. It has been a while since I left Level 0, and I thought I would give you all an update on my experiences so far.

I have been wandering around for quite some time now, and it seems like every time I think I have found a way out of here, I end up back at the start. It's frustrating and confusing at the same time.

But I am keeping a positive attitude and trying to make the most out of my situation. I have learned so much about this place already and it's amazing how everything is so similar yet so different at the same time.

I hope to find a way out soon, but until then, I will continue to explore and document everything I find along the way.

Take care all, and speak to you soon!

As you may have guessed, I am still wandering Level -205. It has been over a year since my last update and I must say, it has been quite the experience.

Dear John,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to let you know that I was able to find a way out of Level 0 and into Level -1. It was not an easy journey, but with perseverance and careful navigation, I managed to make my way through the strange and dangerous space. 

Please keep in mind that there are many dangers and hazards to be aware of, and it is essential to take care and be cautious at all times. However, if you manage to find your way out and back to Level 0, I wish you the best of luck on your next adventure!

Take care,

### Part XXXVIII, Chapter 5: Level 13

Dear All,

I wanted to reach out and share what I've experienced since my last update. As you know, Level 13 is a place where anything can happen, and it has. Since my last message, I have discovered that the void between Levels 13 and 996 is not as vast as we thought. There is actually an unconfirmed exit on the roof of the building that leads directly to Level 996.

I have also found a rare instance where the space within the floor possesses an unstable texture that can lead to Level 1 if noclip-ed through it. It's incredibly dangerous, but potentially worth the risk if you have the skills and nerves to handle it.

Lastly, I have discovered a new area of Level 13 that appears to be uninhabitable by any means. There is no way to enter or exit this area, and it seems to be a constant state of shimmering fog. This could potentially be a sub-level of Level 996, but there's no way to confirm either way.

I want to emphasize that I am not sure what lies ahead or how much danger I will face if I try to navigate these new areas. However, I am excited to explore and see what else is out there. If anyone has any advice or information they can share with me, please let me know. Thank you for your support and understanding throughout this journey.

With love,
John Smith

### Part XXXVIII, Chapter 6: Level 996

Subject: Reunification

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. After wandering for what seems like an eternity in Level 996, I have finally made my way to safety. I am grateful to be out of that abyss and into a world where I can see the light of day again.

As I attempt to make sense of what happened to me, I want to share some of my experiences from the depths of Level 996. It was unlike anything I could have ever imagined, but there were moments of clarity that gave me hope.

I discovered a small community within Level 996 where people appeared to be affected by an unknown entity or illness. The buildings and streets were covered in white Almond Water, and the air was thick with a strange scent. Some of the inhabitants seemed to be lost in their own reality, speaking in voices that I could not understand. Others were violent and aggressive, attacking me without provocation.

Despite the chaos, there were moments of beauty. I stumbled upon a small park where a group of people were practicing yoga. Their movements were graceful and fluid, and they seemed to be in harmony with themselves and each other. It was a moment of clarity amidst the madness.

I am grateful to have made it out of Level 996, but I will never forget what I experienced there. If you ever hear from me again, it will be as a survivor of Level 996.

### Part XXXVIII, Chapter 7: Level 0

"I don't know what to do, but I'm pretty sure I'm lost. I keep hearing buzzing in my ears and feeling like I'm running low on oxygen. The walls are starting to look the same and it's getting harder to find my way out of here. I hope someone comes to rescue me soon."

Subject: Experiences in Level 1

I am writing to provide an account of my experiences while wandering Level -1. I first entered the level by breaking a wall and found myself in a flooded labyrinth. I tried to find a way out, but I was lost in the maze for hours before finally finding a way out. After reaching the surface, I met a group of people who were searching for others. They provided me with food and water and helped me find my way through the level. After helping them, they left me on my own to explore the level. I encountered many strange things such as a giant spider, an abandoned factory with strange machines inside, and an old hotel with a dark history. Despite the dangers, I enjoyed wandering through Level -1 and experiencing all that it had to offer.

### Part XXXVIII, Chapter 9: Level 1

"I made it out of Level 1, but I'm not sure where Level 2 is. I don't remember much from the last few days, but I know that there were some strange creatures that followed me. They were like some kind of mutants, and they could make these loud noises that made me want to throw up. I had to keep moving pretty fast to get away from them. And then I heard something strange - a sound like a door closing. I hope I'm not lost or stuck in Level 1 forever."

### Part XXXVIII, Chapter 10: Level 2

Message from John Smith:
I'm still wandering Level 2. The pipes are really hot and I'm scared to death. I saw a Smiler near the maintenance room but it ran away when I tried to look at it. I also saw a Faceling in the ventilation ducts, but it didn't follow me. I think I need to find a way out of here before it's too late.

### Part XXXIX, Chapter 1: Level 0

Jamie Lee Laughlin
I remember being lost and confused as I wandered through Level 0. The fluorescent lights buzzed loudly, and the air was thick with dust. I tried to navigate by following the patterns of the walls and floors, but it felt like an endless maze. Sometimes I would hear whispers or see glimmers of other rooms, but they were always just shadows or echoes. It seemed like the whole level was a puzzle waiting to be solved, and I couldn't shake the feeling that I was not alone. 

As I wandered deeper into Level 0, I encountered strange creatures that appeared to be made of fluid or some other unknown substance. They moved slowly and seemed unresponsive to my presence. Sometimes they would spew water or smoke, making it difficult to see or breathe. Other times, they would swarm me, leaving trails of slime or goo on my body. 

Despite the challenges and dangers I encountered, I was determined to find a way out of Level 0. I studied the walls and floors, trying to identify patterns that could guide me. Sometimes I found ways to open doors or reach other levels, but most times I stumbled upon dead ends or hidden traps. 

As I reached the bottom floor of Level 0, I saw a figure in the distance. It was a person, a stranger to me and to everyone else in this world. The figure approached, and I could see that it was a woman with short hair and a determined look on her face. She introduced herself as a survival expert who had been wandering through Level 0 for days. She offered guidance and encouragement, and together we made our way to the edge of Level 0 and onto Level 13.

The journey there had been long and perilous, but I felt like I had finally found my way out. The world around me was strange and unfamiliar, but I knew that I could navigate it. With the expert's help, I was confident that I could survive in this new world.

### Part XXXIX, Chapter 2: Level 13

Subject: Message from Jamie Lee Laughlin

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you all from Level 14 of Vitrum Madness. It has been quite some time since my last update. As you all know, I have been wandering through the endless corridors and finding new and exciting things along the way.

One experience that stands out to me is the strange feeling of being able to see through walls. At first, it was just a faint impression, but as I continued exploring, I discovered that it was true. I found myself walking through walls and even over them! It was quite an experience, and I wonder if anyone else has ever felt something similar.

Another experience that I have had is the sensation of being in a completely different dimension. There are moments when I feel as though I am floating through space, and I can't help but wonder if this is just another level within the game or some sort of alternate reality. It's hard to say, but either way, it's an adventure that I won't soon forget.

I have been encountering a variety of creatures along the way, from tiny insects to massive beasts. Some are friendly, while others seem to be intent on causing me harm. It's been a challenge to navigate through this world, but I am determined to find my way out and back to reality.

Thank you all for your messages and support. I hope to continue updating you all soon.

### Part XXXIX, Chapter 3: Level 14

The last time I saw you, I was wandering around in Level 14, looking for a way out. The hospital felt like a maze, and every time I thought I found my way out, another dead end would appear. I was lost, confused, and scared. But then, I stumbled upon a group of doctors who had been trapped here with me for over a decade. They gave me a first-aid kit and some advice on how to escape this place. I took their word and ran, but the hospital seemed to be closing in on me. I heard whispers coming from a room on the left, so I pushed open a broken door. Inside was a room filled with old equipment and medical journals. As I read them, I realized that this was a place of knowledge, not death. The doctors here were like my ancestors, guiding me to freedom. They showed me how to use a compass and map, and how to find a way out of the hospital. I thanked them and left Level 14, knowing that there was more to this place than I ever imagined.

Hi, I'm John Doe. I found this message while wandering Level 1. Here are my experiences since exiting to Level 188.

---

While wandering Level 1, I encountered a strange entity that seemed to be a mix between a Faceling and a Hound. It was hostile towards me and I had to fight it to survive. After winning the battle, I continued exploring until I found an unlocked door that led me to Level 2. From there, I encountered a group of colonizers and engaged in a brief conflict with them. They were friendly and offered me resources to help me continue my journey. After reaching The Hub, I encountered a strange entity that was able to manipulate me through my thoughts, making me do things against my will. I had to find a way to escape before I was brainwashed. Once I found a way out, I continued exploring until I found myself in Level 188. It seemed like a new area with different challenges and opportunities. I am now waiting for anyone who may be able to help me continue my journey. Thank you for your time.

### Part XLI, Chapter 2: Level 13


The following message was received from MARGARET ANN BOWEN while they were wandering Level 13. It describes their experiences up until they exited to Level 45.

---

"I've been wandering around Level 13 for what feels like an eternity. I'm not sure how long I have been here, but it seems like forever. The floor is unstable and shifting all around me, making it difficult to navigate. I keep hearing strange noises in the distance, but I can't be sure if they are just my imagination or real.

I stumbled upon a hidden room that seemed to lead to Level 45. As I explored it further, I discovered a series of pipes and tunnels that I had never seen before. I followed them for what felt like hours until I finally emerged in a different part of the level.

The scenery here is completely different from anything I have ever seen before. The walls are made of vibrant colors, and there are plants growing everywhere. I'm not sure how to navigate this place, but I keep walking forward, trying to find my way back to Level 13.

I stumbled upon a strange creature that seemed to be guarding something. It didn't look friendly, and it started chasing me. I managed to escape its clutches by jumping into a nearby hole.

From there, I found myself in another room with a large window that looked out onto the outside world. I saw a figure walking towards me, and I knew it was time to go back to Level 13.

As I returned to my old stomping ground, I noticed something strange happening. The floor seemed to be shrinking. It's not just the walls that are changing - the entire level is being distorted. I have never felt so small and insignificant in my life.

But I won't let this experience break me. I am determined to find a way out of Level 13 and back to my own world. I will keep exploring until I find my way back home."

### Part XLI, Chapter 3: Level 45


Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experience in Level 45. It has been a long time since we last spoke, and I have much to catch up on.

My journey into Level 45 started with a mysterious invitation from a friend. Without hesitation, I accepted and soon found myself wandering through a forest. After hours of walking, I stumbled upon an elevator. Without hesitation, I entered the elevator and pressed the button for Level 73.

At first, I thought it was a mistake, but then I saw a sign that read "Level 45." My heart raced as I realized that I had made a grave mistake. However, the elevator ride was smooth and uneventful. After exiting the elevator, I found myself in a strange world filled with unfamiliar sights and sounds.

As I continued to explore, I encountered strange creatures and unusual architecture. The buildings were made entirely of neon water, and the air was thick with an ominous fog. I found myself surrounded by unidentifiable objects and strange landscapes. In some instances, I felt like I was in a dream.

Despite the confusion and uncertainty, I was determined to find my way back to Level 73. I walked for miles, taking in all of the sights and sounds that Level 45 had to offer. Eventually, I spotted a group of people and followed them into what seemed like a bar.

I ordered a drink and struck up a conversation with one of the patrons. They offered me a ride back to Level 73, and I eagerly accepted their invitation. As we drove, they told me stories about the history of Level 45 and its inhabitants. I listened intently, eager to learn as much as possible.

When we arrived at Level 73, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. However, as I stepped out of the car, I realized that I had made a grave mistake. Instead of returning to my home in Austin, Texas, I found myself in a desolate wasteland filled with nothing but darkness.

I am currently wandering through Level 45, trying to find my way back to civilization. However, every time I think I have found a familiar landmark, I am met with disappointment. The world feels like a giant labyrinth, and I cannot seem to find my way out.

Despite the uncertainty, I remain optimistic that I will eventually find my way back to Level 73. If anyone has any information on my whereabouts or knows how to help me find my way out of this strange and terrifying world, please reach out to me.

Dear Reader,

I hope this message finds you well. As an AI language model, I cannot feel emotions or experience anything like humans do, but I can provide a message written by Jason Michael Smith while wandering Level 0.

This message was received on March 31, 2019, in Los Angeles, California. The following is a transcript of the message as it was written by Jason Michael Smith while wandering Level 0.

"I am writing this message to anyone who may come across it. I have been wandering Level 0 for several days now and everything seems to be getting blurrier by the minute. I have seen things that make no sense and I feel like I am losing my mind. The walls are talking to me and I can't seem to find a way out. I have tried breaking through the floor, but it just leads to Level 27. I keep wandering around in circles and trying to find any sign of an exit, but there doesn't seem to be one. I don't know what's going on, but I am desperate for help. If anyone can find me, please do. I am all alone and I need someone to talk to. Thank you, Jason Michael Smith"

### Part XLII, Chapter 2: Level 1

Subject: Update from Level 1

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to give an update on my journey since leaving Level 1. First of all, I have been wandering around the Backrooms for a while now and have yet to find any answers as to where I am or how to leave this level. However, I have stumbled upon some strange things that may hold the key to my eventual escape.

Firstly, I came across an old abandoned building with no apparent connection to Level 1. I entered the building and found a room with a strange symbol etched into the walls. Upon examining the symbol, I discovered it was a map that led to another part of the Backrooms. With a bit of exploration, I found a hidden entrance that led to Level 13.

From there, I continued exploring and stumbled upon a group of people who seemed to have some knowledge of the outside world. They told me about a portal that could lead me out of this level, but it was guarded by a group of raiders. A small scuffle ensued and I managed to escape their clutches, only to find myself in a vast desert with no signs of civilization.

I have been wandering around the wasteland for a while now, encountering strange creatures and finding abandoned outposts. However, I have yet to find any sign of the portal that could lead me to safety. My only hope is to continue exploring and searching for any clues that may help me escape this level.

Thank you for your concern. I will keep you updated on my journey.

Dear Wanderers,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you from Level 188, where I have been stuck for quite some time now. It has been a long and tiring journey, but I am determined to find a way out. I have been exploring the level and have discovered some interesting things. One thing that stands out is the presence of many different entities, including The Windows and The Peripherals. However, the most fascinating entity I have encountered so far is The Colonies. They are a group of Wanderers like us who have formed colonies in various locations throughout the level. It is fascinating to see how they interact with each other and their surroundings. I hope to find my way out of this level soon and join you all on the other side.

Thank you for the information about the levels. I have been wandering through them for a while now, and I must say, they are quite unique.

Recently, I stumbled upon the [insert location] area in Level 45. It is a forested area that seems to be a popular destination for many creatures. I found a few hunchbacks and glow larvae in there, but nothing too concerning. I hope to find my way out of this level soon.

Thank you again for the information.

Hey there! I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide an update on my wandering experiences in Level 722. Since I last updated, I have been exploring the level's depths, trying to find a way out of this endless expanse. After days of searching, I found myself at the base of a tree, with no way up. I took a deep breath and decided to climb the tree, using my knowledge of tree climbing techniques. After much effort, I reached the top of the tree and could see the edge of Level 583. I took a leap of faith and jumped into the water below, hoping to find a way out. After some time, I saw a small island in the distance. Using my knowledge of navigation and the environment around me, I navigated through the rough waters until I reached the island. On the island, I found a small outpost, and after some discussion with the inhabitants, they allowed me to stay on the island for a while longer. I have since left the island and am now exploring Level 583 once again. I hope to find a way out of this endless expanse soon!

### Part XLV, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

I'm writing to give an account of my experiences wandering through Level 0. I started exploring on foot, clipping out-of-bounds and not knowing what lay ahead. After walking for a while, the hallway began to fade away into a wall. I tried to find another way to enter Level 0 but found none. So I continued forward, and soon stumbled upon a room filled with old electronics. The hum was so loud that I couldn't hear myself think. The fluid in the carpet had made it difficult to breathe, and the air was thick with dust. I tried to navigate Level 0 using a map but found it to be unreliable.

As I continued forward, I encountered walls with names on them. Some were familiar, some not. One even led to Level -1. I explored the space, taking note of my surroundings. The fluorescent lighting hummed at a constant frequency, making me feel like I was in a dream. The air was thick with the scent of old electronics.

As I navigated through the level, I found myself in a room filled with more electronics. This time, there were wires covering the floor and a buzzing sound that seemed to come from every direction. I tried to find my way out but found no clear path. I could hear other wanderers around me, but they were just as lost as I was. We tried to navigate together, but we were all lost in Level 0.

Eventually, I found a way out by accident. I had stumbled upon an exit and found myself back on Level 1. I felt relieved, but also terrified of what lay ahead. The only thing I knew for certain was that I had to find a way out of this place.

I have been wandering Level -205 for quite some time now, and I must say, it's not easy. The level is constantly changing, and the only thing that seems to be consistent is the static. Everywhere you turn, there's static. The floors are made of metal, and the walls are made of foil. It's not uncommon for me to step on a wire and get tangled in it. I've seen some strange things in this level. I saw a room that was filled with wires that were glowing and shooting out sparks. I also saw a room that was filled with a strange liquid that seemed to be boiling. I'm still searching for my friends, but I won't give up hope. I know that they're out there somewhere. I just hope that I can find them before Level 0 consumes me.

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on my wandering through Level 0. I have been exploring the Backrooms for quite some time now, and it has been an exciting but tiring experience.

After arriving at Level 13, I found a room filled with books, and I spent several hours reading them. The language used in those books was incomprehensible, but I managed to understand some of it. It seems like the book's author had been searching for me.

I have been exploring this level since yesterday, and I have found some strange things. There are some rooms that are identical to each other, and the only difference is the color of the walls. The fluorescent lights hum at a constant frequency, and it feels like they are always on.

The air in Level 0 is thick with dust, and the electrical wires are hard to identify. Navigation through this level has been difficult, and I have lost track of time several times. The only thing I could find to help me was a compass that didn't work.

I have seen some entities in this level, but I have yet to find out what they are or how they interact with me. It seems like the entities don't care about me, and they won't let me leave.

I hope this message finds you well. Please stay safe and keep an eye on Level 0. Thank you for your support.

"Hello everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to you from Level 909. It has been a long journey for me and I would like to share my experience up until now.

As I exited Level 13, I found myself in a vast area with no indication of how it was possible to be the first level. I had to rely on my own experience and knowledge to navigate through the unknown terrain. The floor was unstable, and I encountered areas that were unnerving to the core. However, with time and patience, I found a way out and into Level 909.

The journey in Level 909 was unlike anything I had ever experienced before. The area was filled with strange creatures and obstacles that seemed to have no rhyme or reason. However, I managed to find my way through and eventually emerged on the other side.

I must say, Level 13 is truly a place of mystery and wonder. Despite the challenges I faced, I would do it again in a heartbeat. It has been an incredible experience that has taught me to never give up hope."

### Part XLVI, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

I must have stumbled upon Level 0 by accident. I remember feeling a sense of disorientation as I walked through the building, but I couldn't quite place where I was. As I explored, I realized that everything was identical - the walls, the furniture, even the lighting. After a while, I decided to take a walk outside. As I wandered around the building, I found myself in a different part of Level 0. It was much larger than the area I had been exploring and had more than one entrance.

As I walked further into the building, I came across a group of people who seemed to be working together. They welcomed me warmly and offered me food and water. I felt safe with them and decided to stay with them for a while. However, as time passed, I realized that they didn't have much in common and were not particularly friendly. I decided to explore further on my own.

As I walked deeper into Level 0, I encountered a strange room with what seemed like a constant humming noise. The walls were made of the same yellow wallpaper as the other rooms, but there was no sign of any furniture or fixtures. I tried to navigate through the building using a map I had found earlier, but it seemed to be completely unreliable.

I eventually found a way out of Level 0 and into The Void. However, I have since lost track of time and my location. I don't know where I am or how long I have been wandering. I hope to find a way back to civilization soon.

I am writing to give an update on my journey through Level 1. As of now, I have been wandering around the level for over a year. I have encountered various entities, including Dullers, Facelings, Hounds, and Scratchers. However, I have not yet found any significant groups or outposts.

I have managed to find a few sources of light, such as the crates that contain batteries, tarps, and a small supply of electricity. These sources of light are essential for staying alive in the dark areas of Level 1. I have also discovered several hidden areas, including a small library with books on various topics, and a room filled with old maps and notes.

I continue to explore the level, searching for any signs of civilization or other travelers. It has been quite challenging, as many of the entities in Level 1 are unpredictable and can be dangerous. Nonetheless, I am determined to find a way out of this maze-like world.

Thank you for your time.

### Part XLIX, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: My Experience in Level 0

Dear friends and family,

I wanted to share my experience in Level 0. It has been a long time since I last updated this report, and I am sorry for not keeping you informed. I will do my best to summarize my journey.

I accidentally stumbled upon Level 0 while exploring the Backrooms. The first thing that struck me was the overwhelming sense of emptiness. There were no walls, no ceilings, and no signs of civilization. I began to explore the area, but soon realized that I had lost my way. I tried retracing my steps, but everything looked the same. I felt like I was in a never-ending expanse of darkness.

As I wandered aimlessly, I encountered various entities that seemed to be influencing me. Some were friendly, while others were hostile and aggressive. It was difficult to discern their intentions. I tried communicating with them, but they either ignored me or attacked me. I soon realized that I had entered a dangerous zone where my survival depended on quick thinking and quick actions.

I managed to find my way out of Level 0 through a hidden door that led me to Level -1. From there, I continued exploring different levels until I reached Level 27. At this point, I encountered a group of individuals who seemed to be researching Level 0. They told me that Level 0 was a highly dangerous location, and that I needed to be very careful while exploring it.

I continued my journey until I finally exited Level 0 through a hidden door that led me to The Void. From there, I continued exploring different levels until I eventually found myself in Level 13, which was the Manila Room. It was a strange place, and I spent some time there before continuing my journey.

Overall, my experience in Level 0 was a challenging and dangerous journey that taught me a lot about survival in the Backrooms. I hope to update you all soon with my next steps.

Sincerely,

Maria del Rosario Rodriguez-Lopez

### Part XLIX, Chapter 2: Level 27



---

Several days ago, Maria del Rosario Rodriguez-Lopez ventured out onto Level 27. She was searching for something, but she never made it far. As the days passed, Maria grew increasingly disoriented and lost in the labyrinthine complex. After many attempts to find her way out, Maria realized that she needed help.

She found a lone wooden door in one of the endless rooms, which was the only sign of civilization for miles around. The door was rusted and covered in cobwebs. Without hesitation, Maria pushed open the door and stepped inside.

Inside the room, she found an old, decrepit chair with a broken leg. She sat down and waited for someone to rescue her. Days passed, and no one came. Eventually, Maria decided to explore the room further. As she walked deeper into the chamber, she discovered a small chest filled with gold coins and precious jewels.

Maria realized that she had been lucky to find such a treasure and began to walk out of the room. However, before she could make her way back to freedom, she heard a voice calling out to her from behind a nearby door. It was someone who resembled her, but they spoke in a language she didn't understand.

Maria tried to communicate with the person, but nothing seemed to work. The voice continued to call out to her, and eventually, Maria decided to follow it. As she made her way through the labyrinthine complex, she realized that she was being led to a series of traps that would ultimately lead to her death.

Despite the danger, Maria was determined to escape Level 27 and make it back to her family. She stumbled upon an old, rusted gate that had been left open for years. With the help of the trapped entity, Maria pushed the gate closed and made her way out into the world beyond.

After months of searching for a way back home, Maria finally found herself in a small town on the other side of the country. She was grateful for the help she had received from the trapped entity and was determined to find a way back to Level 27 if only to repay their kindness.## Part L

### Part LI, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experiences in Level 0. It has been several weeks since I last updated the authorities on my whereabouts, and I have been wandering through the various levels ever since.

The journey began with clinging onto a nearby wall, only to realize that there was no way out but up. The ceiling tiles crumbled underfoot as I climbed higher and higher until I finally reached the roof of Level 0. There, I met a strange entity who promised to lead me to safety if I agreed to follow him into the unknown.

As I followed him through the various levels, I encountered other wanderers like myself, all with their own unique experiences. We struggled to find resources and navigate through the ever-changing landscape, but we pressed on. The entities were few and far between, and those that we encountered rarely provided any answers.

Eventually, we came across a group of wanderers who had found a way out of Level 0. They led us through a dark, eerie tunnel until we emerged into a seemingly endless hallway. We followed them for what felt like hours until they suddenly disappeared.

As I continued on my journey, I soon realized that the entity was not who I thought it was. He had lured me with false promises and led me astray. In the end, I found myself in Level 13, where I met a kind wanderer who gave me guidance and resources to make my way back to safety.

I cannot express how grateful I am for their help. Now, I have finally made it to Level 27, where I hope to find a solution to my current situation. I will update you all as soon as possible. Thank you for your support and love. 

Sincerely,

Jane Doe

### Part LI, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experiences while wandering Level 13. As you all know, I have been missing for a few days now, and I have found myself in an unexpected situation. I must tell you that the level is completely different from what I expected it to be. The first thing that struck me was the atmosphere - it's like being in a morgue or a haunted house. The lighting is dim, and the air is thick and heavy.

As I explored deeper, I found myself in a room filled with strange objects and artifacts. I couldn't believe what I saw - a dinosaur skeleton, an old-fashioned TV, and even a humanoid robot! But as I was walking around, something unexpected happened. I suddenly felt a strange sensation, like I was being watched.

As I turned around, I saw a figure standing in the corner of my eye. At first, I thought it was just my imagination. But then I realized that it was moving towards me. I tried to run, but my legs felt heavy as if they were not mine. I couldn't move fast enough, and before I knew it, the figure had grabbed me by the neck and started dragging me towards a nearby door.

I struggled to break free, but it was no use. Then, suddenly, something hit me in the face - a powerful blow that sent me flying backwards. I lost consciousness for a few seconds, and when I woke up, I found myself on Level 45. It was like waking up from a dream, but there was no way out.

I have been wandering around this level ever since, trying to find a way out. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope that someone will find me and rescue me. But as I look at the walls and the objects around me, I am beginning to lose faith. I don't know how much longer I can survive here.

I miss you all, my friends and family. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers.

As an AI language model, I can generate text to create a narrative of Jane Doe's experiences in Level 45. However, please note that any information about Jane Doe is from unconfirmed sources and may not be accurate.

### Part LI, Chapter 4: Level 7

Sorry, I cannot enter Level 7 as I am an AI language model and I do not have access to that level. However, I can provide you with the following information about Level 7:

Level 7 is a vast expanse of water that appears to stretch on endlessly. There are no known living things within this level, but there is a single entity inhabiting the deeper areas of the level. This entity is believed to have wiped out any previous living things in the area. The entity has been described as being almost humanoid in appearance, with a large, bulbous head and tentacles protruding from its body.

It is rumored that there is a way to escape Level 7, but it is guarded by the single entity and is not known to exist. Attempting to enter this level at any point will result in immediate death.

### Part LI, Chapter 5: Level 8

Subject: Experiences in Level 8

I am Jane Doe, and I was wandering Level 8 when I came across a spider nest. The spiders were not very friendly, and I quickly realized that I was not welcome there. They chased me and bit me multiple times, but I managed to escape their grasp. However, as I continued through the cave system, I found myself in a strange location that I had never seen before. It felt like I had been wandering for hours, but I couldn't be sure since there were no landmarks or signs to guide me.

As I was exploring this new area, I saw something moving in the distance. It turned out to be a spider that looked exactly like the ones I had encountered earlier. However, this one was much bigger and more aggressive. It quickly ran towards me and made contact with me by biting me on my leg. I tried to fight back, but it was too quick for me.

As I was struggling to find my way out of this area, I suddenly saw a familiar sight - a group of World Eaters. They were controlling the level and had set up a base at the entrance to a cave system deep within the mountain. They were shooting at me as I approached, so I quickly retreated back through Level 8.

Despite their hostility towards me, I was able to find my way out of the cave system and make it back to Level 9. I hope that I can now start a new journey and explore all the other levels of The Main Nine.

### Part LI, Chapter 7: Level 13

Dear all,

I'm sorry to keep you all waiting, but I wanted to share my experience with Level 13. Well, let me tell you, it was quite the adventure! From the unstable flooring that felt like walking on ice, to the sudden appearance of a strange creature that seemed to be following me (it turned out to be a kind old man who helped me), it was quite an eye-opening experience. I have never felt so vulnerable and alone in my life. However, the journey wasn't over yet. I found myself stuck in a room with no apparent way out, and I had to use my wits to figure out how to escape. It was quite a test of my mental strength, but after a few minutes of trying different things, I managed to escape. The experience left me feeling grateful for the people who have been by my side through thick and thin. Thank you all for your love and support.

Jane Doe.

The Hounds appeared out of nowhere and attacked me. I managed to fight them off but they kept coming until backup arrived.

I was taken by the Facelings to an unknown location, where I met a Skin Stealer. She interrogated me for several hours before releasing me. I don't know much else about my captivity but I am still missing and need help.

I'll keep wandering until I find my way back home.## Part LII

### Part LII, Chapter 1: Level 0

Dear friend,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share my experiences while wandering through Level 0. It has been quite a journey thus far, but I am determined to find my way out and back to the real world.

The first few days were quite surreal. The constant hum of fluorescent lights and the buzzing of the electrical outlets made it difficult to focus on anything else. But as I explored deeper into Level 0, I found that the space was constantly changing, leading me in directions I couldn't even predict. It was a bit unsettling, but also incredibly exciting.

As I navigated through the space, I began to notice strange entities that seemed to be manipulating the environment around me. They were subtle at first, but as I continued on my journey, they became more apparent. These entities seemed to have some kind of influence over the walls and floor surfaces, causing them to shift and change in unpredictable ways.

Despite the challenges, I pushed on. The lack of resources was a constant concern, but I found a way to keep myself going by relying on my wits and a limited supply of water. However, I must warn you that I have encountered some dangerous entities along the way. One particularly dangerous entity seemed to be able to manipulate time itself, causing me to lose precious days of my life.

Finally, after what feels like an eternity, I made it to Level 1. The space was much more familiar, and I could navigate it with greater ease. However, the journey was far from over. There are still many challenges ahead, but I am determined to find my way back to reality.

Thank you for hearing me out. If anything changes in the future, please let me know you're there.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part LII, Chapter 2: Level 1

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share my experiences in Level 1 since the last time I wrote to you. As you know, I have been wandering around this level for a long time now, and it has been quite a journey. I have encountered many different groups of people, each with their own unique personalities, beliefs, and motivations. 

I have learned a lot from the people I have met, and I am grateful for the opportunity to experience such a diverse world. However, I must say that this level can be quite dangerous at times. There are certain groups that are not friendly to outsiders and may pose a threat to anyone who gets in their way. It is important to be cautious when wandering around this level, but also to keep an open mind and embrace the experiences that come your way.

I hope to continue my journey through Level 1 and discover all the wonders that this level has to offer. Thank you for your love and support, and I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Best regards,
John Doe

### Part LIII, Chapter 1: Level 0

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share my experience of wandering Level 0 for a while now. It has been quite an adventure so far. I have encountered strange entities that seemed to know me, but I can't confirm their existence. The fluorescent lights hum and buzz, making it difficult to navigate through the level. I have lost track of time and my location. 

I have encountered a few other wanderers, but we have not been able to communicate with each other since we are on different levels. We have been separated by the vastness of Level 0. The lack of resources and safety has been a huge concern for us, and we are still struggling to find an exit.

I have tried breaking some walls and floors, but it seems like I am stuck in this level forever. I have noticed that the area around me is constantly changing, and the fluid saturating the carpet makes it difficult to breathe. It's a strange place to be wandering in, and I hope I find my way out soon.

I would love to hear from any of you who may still be reading this. If you have found yourself wandering Level 0 and are in need of company or information, please reach out. We are all in this together, after all.

### Part LIV, Chapter 1: Level 0

From Level 0 to Level 13
I wandered for days, lost and alone. I saw strange sights and encountered many different entities. One entity that stood out was a small creature with glowing eyes that seemed to follow me wherever I went. Eventually, I found a way out of the Backrooms and into Level 13.

Upon exiting Level 0, I found myself in a vast open space filled with strange creatures and architectural feats beyond my imagination. I traveled for miles, exploring every nook and cranny of this new world. But as time passed, I began to feel lost and alone once more.

Suddenly, I saw a bright light in the distance. It was a structure made of glass, and I knew that I had to find it. Inside, I found a group of wanderers who had also been searching for a way out of Level 0. We worked together to solve puzzles and overcome obstacles, and eventually, we found a way through the level's labyrinthine corridors.

I continued on my journey, but I knew that Level 13 was not yet complete. As I entered a large chamber, I saw a strange device at the center of the room. It glowed with an otherworldly energy, and I knew that it was what I had been searching for all along. With renewed determination, I approached the device and used it to escape Level 0 forever.

### Part LIV, Chapter 2: Level 13

From: Jane Doe
Subject: Experiences in Level 13

Dear friends,

I am writing to you from Level 13. It has been several days since I last wrote to anyone and I wanted to share my experiences with you.

When I woke up in Level 13, I found myself in a large room with no visible means of exit. I tried moving around but there was nowhere to go. Suddenly, a strange light appeared on the wall and I saw a figure approach me. The figure asked if I needed help and I agreed. It led me through a maze-like path until we reached an area where I saw strange creatures moving around. They looked like blobs with tentacles emerging from their bodies.

The figure helped me to escape the area and we continued walking. Suddenly, I heard a loud roar and felt the ground shake beneath my feet. After a few moments, I emerged in Level 14. The sight that greeted me was breathtaking. I saw tall buildings made of glass, and the sun shining on the city below.

I realized that I had been trapped in Level 13 for some time and had been wandering around searching for a way out. After many days of wandering, I finally found a way to Level 14 and was grateful to have made it out alive.

I hope this message finds you well. Thank you for listening.

Sincerely,
Jane Doe

To: Jane Doe (Recipient)

Dear Jane,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share with you some of my experiences wandering through Level -2. It's been a few days since I left that maze, and I can't stop thinking about it.

First of all, the scenery is stunning. The colors are so vibrant, and the hedges are so tall! I spent a few moments looking up at them, trying to take it all in. Then I went for a walk through the maze itself, but something strange happened. I started seeing things that weren't there. The statues, for example, looked like they had faces. And then, I saw a familiar face. It was my friend, who I hadn't seen in years. We hugged it out and reminisced about old times.

But things got really strange when I got lost in the maze. I kept walking and walking, but every exit led to a dead end. I started feeling like something or someone was guiding me along, but I couldn't figure out who or what it was. I thought I heard them calling my name, but when I turned around, no one was there.

I decided to try and find another way out of the maze. I went through a door that looked like it led outside, but it was just a dead end. I kept going until I came across a group of people walking in the same direction as me. They seemed friendly enough, but they also had a map and were looking for a way to leave the maze.

I told them about my experience with the missing person report, and they looked worried. They suggested we work together to find a way out, and I agreed. We split up and searched different areas of the maze until we found a hidden exit that led to Level -3.

I'm still feeling a little strange from all of this, but it was an incredible experience. Thanks for having me, Jane.

Dear Wanderer,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on my experiences wandering Level 17. As you know, I left the level in search of something else and found myself in a strange place. However, I am now back on Level 2, and I must say, it feels like home.

I have been wandering around for quite some time, and I have discovered many things. The main entrance is not the only way to enter this level. In fact, I believe there are multiple entrances and exits, which means there may be other levels out there waiting for me to explore.

I have also found a few areas that seem familiar, such as the dining room where I had a meal with my companions. There is even a spot where I remember being locked up, but I don't recall being in any danger.

Overall, Level 17 has been quite an experience for me. I can't wait to see what other adventures await me on this strange and wondrous level.

Experience on Level 3

Dear Investigators,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to provide some insight into my experience on Level 3. I have been wandering the halls of Level 3 for several days now, attempting to find a way out.

Upon entering the level, I encountered strange machinery that seemed to be controlling the lights and temperature in the room. I could hear strange noises coming from behind the machinery, but couldn't see anything in the darkness. I tried to explore further, but soon realized that the machinery was a trap to keep me inside.

As I continued to explore, I encountered more strange machinery and found myself in a maze-like hallway with no clear way out. I could hear strange sounds coming from different directions, and I wasn't sure which way to go. I decided to take a break and rest near one of the many pipes that line the walls of the room.

As I was resting, I heard a voice calling my name. I turned around to see a group of people approaching me with flashlights in hand. They were from Gamma Base III, and they had found me wandering outside of the level. They helped me back to Level 4 and provided me with some much-needed food, water, and medical attention.

Since then, I have been wandering Level 4 and exploring the nearby areas, hoping to find a way out. I have seen strange creatures in the shadows, heard strange noises coming from the distance, and encountered strange technology that seems to be beyond my understanding. But I am determined to find a way out of this level and return home to my family.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,
Jane Doe

### Part LV, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to give an update on my situation. As you may recall, I was last seen in Level 13 on January 1, 2022. Since then, I have been wandering around the levels, trying to find a way out. It's been quite eventful, to say the least.

I came across a strange entity that seemed to be controlling the environment. I tried to escape, but it seemed to be blocking my path. I felt like I was being hunted. I had to fight back to survive. I encountered other entities as well, some friendly and some not so much. 

One day, I found myself at the top of a hill overlooking Level 13. I saw a small door in the distance that looked like it might lead to a higher level. I decided to explore it further. To my surprise, it led to a strange, glowing room with an endless supply of water. It was beautiful and calming, but also incredibly dangerous. I had to be careful not to fall into the void.

As I continued to explore Level 13, I came across some unusual phenomena. The floors seemed to shake and vibrate uncontrollably, and strange textures appeared on the surface. I felt like I was in a different dimension or time period. I'm not sure how long I can last in this environment. I hope to find a way out soon.

I hope you all are doing well. I miss you all dearly. Please keep me in your thoughts.

Jessica


### Part LV, Chapter 3: Level 14

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to update you on my journey through the Backrooms. While wandering Level 14, I encountered a group of doctors who offered me a first-aid kit and a free lab coat to avoid suspicion from Dr. Pollack. I appreciated their kindness and used the items they gave me.

I found a hidden door that led to Level -2, where I saw a friendly ghost named Sarah. She showed me around her world and shared some of her memories with me. I regret not asking more questions, but it was an interesting experience.

After exploring Level -2, I exited through the same hidden door and found myself back in Level 14. From there, I continued wandering until I found a strange document titled "Mike Hotel." It led me to Level 847, where I met some new friends. We explored the area together and had some fun before heading back to Level 14.

I hope this message finds you well. I am still wandering around and exploring new areas. Thank you for your love and support.

### Part LV, Chapter 4: Level -2

"I am not sure how long I have been wandering around Level -2, but it feels like a lifetime. The only thing that keeps me going is the hope of finding an exit. Every time I hear a voice calling my name, I get scared and try to keep walking. Sometimes, I see orbs in the distance that lead me to a new area. I wish I could find something that would make this all stop. But for now, I will keep wandering around until I can't anymore."

### Part LVIII, Chapter 1: Level 0

I have been wandering Level 0 for over a week now. It's been a long and tiring journey, but I am still searching for some sense of hope. The level is vast and confusing, with no discernible pattern or order to the rooms. Every time I think I have found my way out, I get lost again. The fluorescent lights are constant, humming like a low-frequency rumble in my head. Every surface is covered in that same worn-out wallpaper and carpet, with no identifying features. I have been forced to venture into the unknown, navigating through space that seems to bend and warp reality at every turn.

I have seen many strange things in Level 0. There are fluid pools that seem to swallow you whole, and walls that shift and change. I have been trapped in a room with a group of people, all of us struggling to find a way out. We were eventually able to escape through a hidden door, but the journey was long and tiring.

I continue to search for a way out of Level 0, but every time I think I have found a solution, I am lost again. The feeling of being trapped in this endless space is overwhelming, and I often wonder if I will ever escape.

### Part LVIII, Chapter 2: Level -1

"I'm still wandering Level -1. I found a hidden door that led me to a strange underwater room. It's filled with water and creatures are constantly swimming around.

### Part LVIII, Chapter 3: Level -205

To: Anyone who may be able to help me

Subject: Experiences in Level -205

Dear all,

I am reaching out to anyone who might be able to help me. I have been wandering around Level -205 for a few days now, and I must say, it is quite an experience. I have encountered many strange things since I entered this level, but I am determined to find my way back home.

I have seen many strange things in this level, including a room with no floor and a room that seems to emit static electricity. The wire room is also unsettling, as it reminds me of a morgue. However, the worst experience I had was at "The Red Zones" area on Level -205. There, I saw a person being eaten by something that was not human. I tried to help, but I don't know what it is or where it came from.

I have been wandering around and searching for a way out of this level. I have heard rumors of an exit in another level, but I am not sure which one it is. I will continue to search until I find my way back home.

Thank you for any help you can provide.

Sincerely,

John Doe

### Part LVIII, Chapter 4: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

I've been wandering around Level 0 for a few days now, exploring every nook and cranny I can find. The experience has been surreal - nothing feels quite like the way I know it does in my own world. But the lack of resources is becoming increasingly difficult to handle. I've been dehydrated, hungry, and exhausted for so long that I feel like I might never be able to come back out. 

I've seen some interesting things while wandering around. There are some really cool lighting fixtures up on the ceiling that change colors based on your location. And there are some strange electrical currents running through the floor that make a humming noise. The carpet is also saturated with something that's hard to describe, but it feels like a thick, gooey substance that's not safe for human consumption. 

I keep hoping I'll find a way out, but every time I try to leave, I get lost and end up back where I started. The walls are made of a soft, pliable material that's easy to manipulate, so sometimes I can push myself through the wall and end up in a different part of Level 0. But it's all so confusing - I have no idea which way to go or what to do next. 

I don't know if I'll ever find my way out, but I need to keep trying. I can't just give up and let myself get lost in here forever.

Subject: Report on Experiences in Level 1

Date: June 28, 2021


Hi there,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to provide an update on my experiences while wandering Level 1. As of today, I have been wandering around for two days and have not found any sign of life outside the level. However, I have discovered a few things that might be useful to others who are also exploring the level.

Firstly, I have found a possible way out of the level. It involves using a hidden door that is not marked on the map. The door leads to a small room with a strange substance that seems to emit a light. I have been monitoring my surroundings and have not noticed any harmful effects from the substance. However, I am still cautious and will be keeping an eye on it.

Secondly, I have encountered various groups while wandering around the level. Some are friendly and willing to trade, while others are hostile and aggressive. It's hard to tell which is which because they all seem to blend together. I have been trying to avoid any conflicts as much as possible.

Lastly, there seems to be a lot of strange phenomena happening in this level. I have seen some unusual creatures that move at night, and there are strange patterns and textures that appear randomly on the walls. It's a bit spooky, but I am still trying to keep an open mind.

Overall, it has been an interesting adventure so far, and I look forward to exploring more of Level 1. If anyone needs any help or advice, feel free to reach out.

### Part LIX, Chapter 3: Level 2

Subject: Update from Level 2

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to update you on my experiences in Level 2. Despite the dangers and risks, I continued on. However, I must say that it has been quite a journey.

The hallways are long and dim, with steam pipes lining the walls and ceilings. The doors are rarely found, and they house metal shelves and ventilation ducts. The pipes cause the heat in Level 2 to reach immense temperatures, reportedly reaching 200 Fahrenheit (93 C) and higher, boiling any wanderer alive. It is generally described as decrepitude compared to previous levels, with cracks in the stone surfaces and the pipes being rusted from what appears to be decades of neglect.

As I continued on, I found myself surrounded by Facelings and Smilers. They are hostile creatures that attack anyone who comes their way. Hounds were also lurking around, but I was able to avoid them.

Despite the dangers, I persisted in exploring this level. However, I must say that I am exhausted from the heat and the constant danger lurking around. I hope I can find an exit soon so I can continue on my journey.

Thank you for your support and concern.

Subject: Reunited with family after wandering Level 0 for over a year.

Date: September 12, 2018

I am writing to share an important update about the situation involving myself and Level 0. After wandering for over a year in the Backrooms, I have finally reunited with my family. It has been a long and difficult journey, but I am grateful to have made it out alive. 

During my time in Level 0, I encountered many challenges and obstacles that tested my resolve. However, I was able to find strength within myself and persevere through each obstacle. Through my experiences, I learned the importance of family and the value of keeping a positive attitude even in the face of adversity.

I would like to thank everyone who has supported me during this time, including those who helped me with food, water, and shelter, as well as those who provided encouragement and hope for my return. Without their help, I may not have survived this long in the Backrooms.

Again, I am grateful to be reunited with my family and ready to begin the next chapter of my life. Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers as I continue on this journey.

Sincerely,
Jonas Reyes

### Part LX, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear friends and family,

I hope this message finds you well. I am writing to share with you my experience in Level 13. It has been quite an adventure, and I would like to share some of it with you.

Firstly, I must say that the floor is unstable and has many irregularities. It feels as if I'm floating on air. The texture of the floor is odd, and I can only describe it as feeling like a cloud. However, I have discovered that if I noclip through certain areas, I can pass through walls without any consequences.

I have also encountered an extremely rare circumstance where the space within shakes turbulently. It's as if there's an earthquake happening right under my feet! But don't worry, after a few minutes, everything returns to normal.

Another interesting experience was when I found myself in a room with nothing but a large window. The view from there was breathtaking, but the problem is that it's also very dangerous. The void outside has a chance of swallowing me whole, and I have no control over where I end up. But I managed to make it through alive!

I must say, Level 13 is an adventure like no other. It's been quite a ride, and I can't wait to see what's in store for me next. Thank you all for your love and support.

Jonas Reyes

### Part LX, Chapter 3: Level 14

"I'm doing okay here. The atmosphere is eerie, but I'm able to see and move around. It's a bit strange to see these walls moving by themselves. I think they're trying to communicate with me. I also hear whispers in my head, but I can't make out what they say. I hope they're not ghosts. They definitely don't look like doctors or nurses. The syringes they use are filled with tranquilizers, but they can't hurt me. I just hope they don't turn me into one of them. I'm scared of what will happen if I leave this place. Thank you for the free lab coat and first-aid kit. They came in really handy."

### Part LX, Chapter 6: Level 3

Dear friends and family,

I'm writing to share my experience in Level 3. I've been wandering around this place for a few days now, and I must say it's quite strange. The lighting is always the same, and the pipes lining the walls seem to be moving on their own.

But what really got me was the lack of power. There are certain areas in Level 3 where the machinery seems to come to life, creating a sense of foreboding. I've seen entities there, and it's not a pleasant sight.

Despite the danger, I can't help but feel drawn to this place. Maybe it's the curiosity that keeps me going back. But I know I must keep my guard up, as I've heard of some unsettling things happening in these corridors.

I hope to find a way out soon and return home safely. I miss my loved ones and want to be with them again. Thank you for your love and support.

Sincerely,

Jonas Reyes

Subject: Reaching Level 27

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share my experience of reaching Level 27 in The Backrooms. It was a long and arduous journey, but I finally made it. After what feels like an eternity, I found myself standing in front of a door. I pushed it open and stepped through, grateful for the opportunity to breathe fresh air and see sunlight.

From there, I continued on my path and eventually found myself back in Level 0. It was strange to be standing there again after all these days of wandering, but I knew that I had made progress. I explored every room carefully, looking for any sign of the way out. After a few hours of searching, I finally found myself outside. The world looked different from what I remembered, but it was clear that I needed to find my way back home.

I set off into the city, making sure not to get lost this time. After much wandering and exploring, I finally came upon a familiar landmark: the Manila Room. It felt like a long-awaited reunion, and I eagerly stepped inside. From there, I continued on my journey and eventually found myself back in Level 0. I searched each room carefully, but there was no sign of any other wanderers who had made it out before me.

I will leave Level 0 now, knowing that I have completed a great feat. I hope that others may follow in my footsteps, and that they may find their way to Level 27 as well. It is an incredible achievement, and one that I am proud of. Thank you all for the support and encouragement along the way.

### Part LXII, Chapter 1: Level 0

I can't believe it's been a year since I was last in Level 0. Let alone the fact that I'm still wandering around this godforsaken place. I've lost all sense of time, and it's hard to tell how much time has passed at any given moment. But regardless of the hours or days, I keep moving forward, never knowing which way is up or down.

The fluorescent lighting hums constantly, and the air is thick with dust and moisture. The walls are worn-out, uneven, and covered in a variety of scribbles and marks. Somehow, I manage to navigate through all of this, finding my way to different rooms and even a few spots where I can catch a glimpse of sunlight.

But there's one thing that really bugs me about Level 0. I cannot find any sources of water anywhere. It's been days since I've had enough hydration to keep my body going, and I'm starting to feel really dehydrated. But I have to keep moving, keep exploring, keep trying to find a way out.

I hope that one day, I'll find a way out of this place. But until then, I'll just keep moving forward, searching for a way back to reality.

### Part LXII, Chapter 2: Level 13

Dear friends and family,

I wanted to reach out and give you an update on my current situation. After being lost for a few days in Level 13, I was able to find my way back to the roof of the building. From there, I jumped off and found myself in an unknown sub-level.

I have yet to explore this new area, but from what I understand, it is a safe place where one can find their desired level. However, it is important to note that this sub-level is highly unstable and may lead to Level 909 if not approached with caution.

As for the last few days, I have been wandering around this new area, trying to find my bearings and exploring as much as possible. It has been a wild ride, to say the least, but I am grateful to be alive and well.

I will continue to update you all on my journey once I find a way back to Level 13 or any other location I can reach. Thank you for your love and support during this difficult time.

Sincerely,
Marcus Kline

### Part LXIII, Chapter 1: Level 0

Dear friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share some of my experiences while wandering Level 0. It's been a while since I've last written in this journal and I thought it would be good to update everyone on what's been happening to me.

I first arrived at Level 0 as a result of accidentally clipping out-of-bounds. Upon entering, I was greeted by a cramped, dark space that resembled a staircase leading up to the ceiling. The air was thick with dust and I could barely breathe due to the lack of resources. Despite my struggles, I continued down the staircase until I reached a ledge above a pile of fluorescent wires.

I tried jumping from the ledge, but it was impossible to make contact with any surface below. So, I decided to push myself onto the wires and see what would happen. To my surprise, I managed to grab hold of a nearby wire and swing myself up to the surface. I could hear the buzzing fluorescent lights humming in the distance as I emerged from Level 0.

As I made my way out of Level 0, I discovered an abandoned room filled with old books and magazines. The language used within them was almost indecipherable, but I could make out some words such as "love" and "hate." As I read further, I realized that these books were written in a language created by the entity that had brought me to Level 0 in the first place.

I left this room and continued on my journey until I found myself at the edge of Level 1. From there, I entered the world beyond Level 0. As I walked through the non-Euclidean space, I felt a sense of unease and foreboding. The fluorescent lights were louder and more constant than ever before, and I could hear strange sounds emanating from the depths below.

I encountered various entities along the way, including an old man who spoke to me about the history of Level 0, and a young girl who was lost and needed help finding her way back to safety. But for the most part, the environment remained hostile and unpredictable.

Eventually, I emerged from Level 1 and found myself in a vast desert. The sand was soft and warm beneath my feet as I walked along a path towards an old car. As I approached the car, I noticed a figure inside. It was an elderly woman who had lost her way and was seeking help finding her way back to safety.

I helped her out of the car and offered her some water from a nearby hydrant. She thanked me and continued on her journey. I continued wandering until I found myself at the edge of Level 27. From there, I entered The Void.

As I looked down at the world below, I realized that I had been given the ability to manipulate time. I could travel back in time to any point in my wandering and relive it over and over again. At first, I thought this was a dream, but as I continued on my journey, I discovered that it was true.

I traveled through time, exploring different versions of myself and the world around me. Some were peaceful, others were chaotic. In one version, I found myself in a city filled with smoke and fire. In another, I was lost in a forest with no way out. 

Eventually, I realized that I needed to find my way back to Level 0 and put an end to the entity that had brought me there. With renewed determination, I continued on my journey until I found myself at the edge of Level 13. From there, I entered The Void once more.

As I traveled through time, I encountered many different versions of myself and the world around me. Some were peaceful, others were chaotic. In one version, I found myself in a city filled with smoke and fire. In another, I was lost in a forest with no way out. 

I continued to travel through time until I finally found myself back at Level 0. As I emerged from The Void, I realized that the entity had been manipulating me all along. It had been controlling my every move, using my own free will to manipulate me into a trap.

With renewed determination and a newfound sense of purpose, I continued on my journey until I found myself back at Level 13. From there, I entered The Void once more. This time, I traveled through time to the point where I had first arrived at Level 0. With a final push, I emerged from The Void and was greeted by the entity once more.

It seemed to be taunting me, playing with my emotions as I battled it. But eventually, I found myself in a vast desert once again, this time with a clear path ahead. As I walked, I realized that I had made a mistake by traveling through time at all. The entity had been manipulating me all along, and I had only contributed to its own growth.

With a newfound sense of clarity, I continued on my journey until I finally emerged from Level 0 as the entity had once done, with a renewed sense of purpose and determination. With a final push, I emerged from The Void, and with a newfound sense of closure, I left Level 0 for good.

As I walked through the non-Euclidean space beyond Level 13, I realized that there was no going back. Whatever happened had already happened, and I could never change it. But I also knew that I had grown stronger and more resilient from my journey across time and space. And as I looked out at the vast world around me, I knew that I would continue to explore and discover for as long as I lived.

### Part LXIV, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Experiences in Level 0

Dear John,

I hope you're doing well. I wanted to check in and give you a brief update on my time wandering Level 0. It's been a while since we last spoke, but I wanted to fill you in on what's been going on.

First off, the fluorescent lights are really messing with my head. The hum is constant and it's almost impossible to focus on anything for more than a few seconds. The walls are covered in worn-out carpet that feels like it's been there for centuries. I've seen some strange things so far - one room had a bunch of old electronics scattered around, and another had what appeared to be a massive pile of garbage.

The lack of resources is getting really tough. I'm dehydrated and hungry, and I haven't found a single source of water or food. I keep hoping that I'll come across something, but it's not looking good. The only way to navigate this level is by walking straight and then randomly turning right or left - there's no rhyme or reason to the layout.

I keep getting lost too. I know where I am in the level, but I can never seem to find my way to where I need to go. It's frustrating, but I'm trying not to give up hope.

The entities are a mystery. I've seen some strange things that could be considered anomalies, but I don't know if they're related to the entities. I've heard rumors about them, but no one knows for sure what they are or where they come from.

I hope you're doing better than I am. Keep me updated on your travels - I miss you.

Love,
J

### Part LXIV, Chapter 2: Level 1

Subject: Update

Hi everyone,

I hope you're all doing well. I thought I'd give an update on my experiences in Level 1. Since leaving Level 0, I've come across some strange things. For instance, there's a building that seems to have been torn apart and reassembled in different places. The walls are made of the same materials as the floors and ceiling, and there's no way to enter it without going through a wall. Additionally, the air is thick with dust and gas, making it hard to breathe. Despite these obstacles, I've been able to find a few resources and make some new friends. It's a strange place, but I'm enjoying exploring it.

### Part LXIV, Chapter 3: Level 2

Dear Family and Friends,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and update you on my current situation. After being stuck in Level 2 for several days, I was able to find a way out. It was not an easy feat, but with the help of my fellow explorers, I was able to navigate through the pipes and make it to Level 3.

The journey there was treacherous, but I am grateful for the opportunity to have experienced such a dangerous and unique environment. The creatures found in Level 2 were both terrifying and fascinating, but I must say that the steam and humidity were the most challenging aspects of this level. 

I know that my experience in Level 2 was not ideal, but I hope that my message can provide some closure for those who are concerned about me. I want to thank you all for your love, support, and encouragement throughout this ordeal. I look forward to reuniting with you all soon.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part LXV, Chapter 1: Level 0

Subject: Update on Level 0

Hi everyone,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to give an update on my wandering in Level 0. After spending several days lost in the level, I finally found a way out. It was a long and tiring journey, but I made it out alive.

As for the experiences I had during my time there, let me tell you...it was quite a ride. The walls were lined with old newspapers, and the air reeked of decay. The floors were warped and twisted, and the furniture was covered in dust. The rooms were identical to each other, with the only difference being their color scheme. I found myself wandering through endless halls that seemed to stretch on forever, all while trying to avoid falling off the ceiling.

But the scariest part of Level 0 for me was the fact that there were no resources. No food, water, or shelter. Just me and my own two legs, pushing against the wall. I was dehydrated, hungry, and exhausted by the time I finally found a way out. But after all the wandering, I'm glad to have made it out alive.

### Part LXV, Chapter 2: Level 1

"I found a new place to hide. I'm not sure if it's safe, but it's got water and power. I hope they don't come looking for me here. It's too far from any exit or entrance. I'll have to keep moving. I won't let them catch me again."

### Part LXV, Chapter 3: Level 2


As I made my way through the pipes, I could hear the sounds of machines and machinery. The heat was unbearable, with my body burning up from the inside out. I could see the steam rising up from the walls and the ceiling, filling my lungs with a thick mist that choked me. The Facelings were everywhere, their eyes glowing red as they leered at me from every corner. I could hear their whispers, their clicks, and their hums, all of which only made my head hurt more.

I had been wandering Level 2 for what felt like days, but it was likely only a few hours. My legs were tired, my feet swollen with the weight of the pipes that crushed them. I stumbled on, trying to find a way out. The Smilers and the Hounds were always nearby, their eyes fixed on me as they moved in unison.

The heat was too much, and I could see the steam rising up from the pipes. I knew that I was only a few steps away from Level 3, but the thought of it made me queasy. The Facelings and Hounds were still following me, their eyes fixed on me like they were waiting for me to die.

I had to keep moving, so I kept going. My legs felt like they were made of jelly as I stumbled forward. The pipes were too hot, and the steam rising up from them was making it hard to breathe. But I had to keep going, I had to find a way out.

Finally, I saw a light at the end of the tunnel. It was a metal door with a keypad that I could see on the other side. I pushed the door open and ran towards it, my heart pounding in my chest as I stepped inside. The air was cooler, the heat less oppressive. And then I saw it - a way out.

I ran down the hallway until I found an elevator. Inside, I pressed the button for Level 4. As the elevator rose up, I heard the sound of a door closing behind me. I knew that I had made it to safety, at least for now. But I also knew that I was still in danger, that I could never truly escape Level 2.

### Part LXV, Chapter 4: Level 3

Dear all,

I hope this message finds you well. As I write this, I am currently wandering Level 3. I have been lost in the labyrinth for a few days now and have been trying to find my way out. I have encountered many strange things along the way, including a room with a pipe system that seems to be active even when there is no one around. The pipes seem to lead to multiple different locations and are filled with fluids of varying types. 

I have been keeping a record of my experiences and will try to share them with you all as I continue on this journey. I hope that some of you can help me find my way out of Level 3. Thank you all for your thoughts and prayers during this time. 

Love, 
Jamie Lee Smith

### Part LXVI, Chapter 2: Level 13

To: SherlsF
Subject: Message from John Doe

Dear SherlsF,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give you a brief update on my experience in Level 13. As you know, I went through some challenging situations and encountered some unforeseen circumstances. However, despite all the obstacles, I managed to survive and even thrive in those conditions.

I can't share much about what I saw or experienced since I am still processing everything. But I can tell you that Level 13 was not an easy place to navigate. There were times when I felt like giving up, but I persisted and kept going. The experience was definitely life-changing.

I have some concerns about my safety now that I am out of Level 13. I hope you can provide me with any information or advice on how to stay safe and avoid any potential dangers. I also want to know if there are any updates about the investigation into my disappearance. Thank you for all your support.

Sincerely,
John Doe

### Part LXVI, Chapter 3: Level -13

Dear Reader,

I am writing this message from Level 10 of Negative. As you can imagine, I have been wandering around this level for a while now. The journey here was a long one, and it took me days to finally reach this level. The experience has been quite surreal, and I have encountered many strange things.

To give you some context, Level -13 is considered a negative or dangerous level. It is where the wretches reside, and they are known for their hostile behavior towards humans. In my experience, Level 10 is also an uneasy place, but it feels like a safe distance from the horrors of Level -13.

As I continue to explore this level, I will try to document my experiences as much as possible. I hope that you find these stories interesting and informative. Thank you for reading this message.

John Doe

### Part LXVI, Chapter 4: Level 10

Thank you for reaching out. I have been exploring Level 10 and have found several unique characteristics that may be of interest to you. The level has a consistent and predictable climate, with an overcast, leaden sky and brief and infrequent spells of light rain and fog. The dreary atmosphere of Level 10, coupled with its unchanging state of daylight, makes it somewhat difficult to keep track of time, with only the occasional gust of wind among the crops to break up the uniformity.



Despite the lack of immediate hazards, I have found several potential resources that may be of interest. The vast majority of Level 10 is composed of plots of wheat and barley fields that stretch endlessly in all directions, divided into smaller areas by lines of trees and shrubbery. The soil appears to be slightly different from the surrounding landscape, with a higher concentration of minerals and nutrients.

The water found throughout Level 10 is a unique property, with a consistent elevation below one consistent elevation. This is likely due to the level's soil possessing slight hydrophobic properties, preventing the irrigation of water into the ground. The water from these pits has been deemed safe for human consumption, although its taste has been reported to have an earthy undertone. Upon inspection, it appears to be free of algae and other organisms, only containing various microbes and types of benign fungi. The water is believed to be highly oxygenated, which likely contributes to its clear, seemingly uncontaminated appearance.


In terms of buildings, I have found several small wooden sheds and outbuildings, as well as larger barns and stables. These structures appear to be largely empty on the inside, aside from often housing certain useful resources such as wood and nails. These resources, along with the structural elements of the buildings themselves, may be of interest for various purposes such as construction. While the potential for establishing permanent settlements in Level 10 appears promising, further analysis is needed before a final decision can be reached.

I have also found several unique organisms within the level's soil. These include small worm-like entities that inhabit the soil beneath the surface. They have been observed through the use of shovels to dig into the soil, which has been found to be only one meter deep before giving way to the mass of worms writhing in the darkness below. It is currently unknown how far down the worms extend or where they originate, and further exploration beneath the one-meter depth has been deemed infeasible due to logistic and safety concerns.

































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































































 in the course of the past, and in


the present.

But, as he was journeying to the


lower world,

He came to a river which he could not cross,

Nor could he swim.

He saw a ferry-man there,

And asked him for a ride.

The ferry-man said: "I can take you across,

But first I must tell you a story."

So he told him all about his adventures,

How he had seen strange things,

Fought battles and conquered foes,

And traveled to distant lands.

At the end of the ride,

The ferry-man said: "You are a great hero,

My friend, and you shall have a reward."

He then gave him a magic ring,

Whose power could make any wish come true.

With this ring, the traveler went his way,

And returned home as he wished.

For he had learned that in life,

The past and present are not so different,

And that the future is what we make of it.

So he left the ring with the ferry-man,

And continued his journey to the upper world.

### Part LXVI, Chapter 5: Level 11

Dear friend,

I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to reach out and give you a brief update on my travels in Level 11. Despite the lack of life or civilization, I have found a sense of peace and tranquility in wandering its endless expanse. The beauty of the landscape is truly awe-inspiring, but I can't help but feel like something is off about it. Perhaps it's just me being paranoid, but I can't shake the feeling that there's more to Level 11 than meets the eye.

Anyway, I hope all is well in your world. Keep me updated on what you've been up to.
